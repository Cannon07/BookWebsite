In this chapter, we briefly review techniques for solving partial
differential equations numerically.

## Finite Element Methods

Finite element methods divide up the solution space into a finite mesh.
Mathematically, a mesh is a collection of points $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{M\} &= \{ (x_i,y_i,z_i,\dotsc) \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ which closely tile an input shape or space. Mesh
elements are typically connected to their nearest neighbors to induce a
graph structure. A finite element method can be rougly broken down into
the recipe

1.  Generate mesh for domain

2.  Do iterated updates of discretized versions of the original PDE
    equations on the mesh

A broad range of methods exists to compute mesh discretizations of
suitable shapes. These methods can work well in lower dimensional
problems but can struggle at high dimensions.

## Mesh Free Methods

A newer class of numerical methods to solve PDEs use mesh-free
representations for solutions [@fasshauer2006meshfree]. Simple mesh-free
methods represent the value of a solution globally by reference to a set
of control points

$$\begin\{aligned\}
u(x,t) &= \sum_i m_i u_i W(x, (x_i,\dotsc))
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $u_i$ is the value at the $i$-th control point,
and $W$ is a distance kernel function. This representation is adapted by
many differentiable PDE solver approaches.

As we have learned, most techniques for numerically solving partial
differential equations use explicit meshes. A newer class of numerical
methods use mesh-free representations for solutions.
