This chapter introduces the basics of quantum circuits, the leading
methodology for describing quantum computations. A quantum circuit can
be viewed as graphical shorthand for matrix algebra. A qubit has two
states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. It follows that a system with
$n$ qubits has $2^n$ states ($|0...0\rangle$ to $|1....1\rangle$). State
transformations for a $2^n$ dimensional quantum system are given by
$2^n \times 2^n$ unitary matrices. A quantum circuit provides a
graphical representation for these large matrices in terms of local
transformations on one or a few qubits at a time.

The diagram below represents a quantum circuit on 3 qubits. Individual
qubits are drawn as lines coming in from the left and going to the
right. Gates are drawn as squares ($H$, $X$, $Z$) or as connecting
elements drawn across multiple lines. Measurements are drawn with an
arrow symbol. The full quantum circuit below is a shorthand for a
$8\times 8$ unitary matrix that represents a state evolution of the
underlying quantum system.

The advantage of a quantum circuit is that composable patterns in the
quantum state transformation can be easily recognized and \"refactored\"
out and reused in new circuits.

## Basic Quantum Gates

In this section, we provide an overview of some important quantum gates.

### Hadamard Gate

The Hadamard gate operates on a single qubit at a time and is given by
the $2\times 2$ unity matrix $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\}\begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & 1 \\
    1 & -1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that $H$ performs the following transformations of
the basis states $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |0 \rangle & \to \frac\{|0\rangle + |1 \rangle\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\} \\
    |1 \rangle & \to \frac\{|0 \rangle - |1 \rangle\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ To verify these equations, you can expand into the
following matrix equations. We follow the convention of multiplying
transfomrations on the left $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H | 0 \rangle &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\} \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & 1 \\
    1 & -1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
    \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 \\
    0 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
    = \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\}\begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 \\
    1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\} \\
     H | 1 \rangle &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\} \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & 1 \\
    1 & -1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
    \begin\{pmatrix\}
    0 \\
    1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
    = \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\}\begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 \\
    -1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Pauli-$X$ Gate

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    X &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |0 \rangle & \to | 1 \rangle \\
    |1 \rangle & \to | 0 \rangle \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Pauli-$Y$ Gate

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Y &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
    0 & -i \\
    i & 0 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    |0 \rangle &\to -i |1 \rangle \\
    |1 \rangle &\to i | 0 \rangle \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Pauli-$Z$ Gate

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    |0 \rangle &\to |0 \rangle \\
    |1 \rangle &\to -|1 \rangle \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

### CNOT Gate

Controlled gates allow for the state of one qubit to act as a control on
the state of another qubit. The controlled not (CNOT) gate is given by
the following matrix $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \textrm\{CNOT\} &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We leave it as an exercise to verify that the CNOT
performs the following set of transformations upon its input states
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    |00 \rangle & \to | 00 \rangle \\
    |01 \rangle & \to | 01 \rangle \\
    |10 \rangle & \to | 11 \rangle \\
    |11 \rangle & \to | 10 \rangle \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Universal Quantum Gates

A collection of gates is said to be universal if an arbitrary unitary
transformation can be approximated by a finite sequence of gates from
this set.
