In previous chapters, we've introduced you to the fundamental forces
that govern all known physics: the electromagnetic, weak, strong, and
gravitational forces. A major goal of modern physics is to unify all
these forces into one theory that describes all known physics. For the
present, such a goal is beyond the reach of modern physics, but
researchers have achieved considerable success in unifying three of the
known forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces) into one unified
theory called the standard model.

In many ways the standard model represents the frontier of known
physics. It has been extensively experimentally tested and produced
extraordinarily accurate predictions. It is also fundamentally limited,
not being capable of explaining gravity.

## The Standard Model Lagrangian

Mathematically, the standard model builds on the machinery of quantum
field theory we've introduced earlier in the book. In particular, the
standard model is defined by a standard Lagrangian that describes the
associated field theory. We will introduce this Lagrangian by writing
down the components of the Lagrangian that correspond to different
forces and interactionns.

### Quantum Chromodynamics

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_\{QCD\} = \sum_\{\psi\} \bar\{\psi\}_i (i\gamma^\{\mu\}(\partial_\{\mu\} \delta_\{ij\} - i g_s G_\{\mu\}^aT_\{ij\}^a)) \psi_j - \frac\{1\}\{4\} G_\{\mu\nu\}^a G^\{\mu\nu\}_a
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Electroweak Force

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_\{EW\} = \sum_\{\psi\} \bar\{\psi\} \gamma^\{\mu\} \left ( i \partial_\mu - g' \frac\{1\}\{2\} Y_W B_\{\mu\} - g \frac\{1\}\{2\} \vec\{\tau\}_L \vec\{W\}_\{\mu\} \right ) \psi -\frac\{1\}\{4\} W_\{\mu\nu\}^a W^a_\{\mu\nu\} - \frac\{1\}\{4\} B^\{\mu \nu\} B_\{\mu \nu\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where $B_\{\mu\}$ is a U(1) gauge field. $Y_W$ is the weak hypercharge,
the generator of the $U(1)$ group. $\vec\{W\}_\{\mu\}$ is the 3-component
$\mathrm\{SU\}(2)$ gauge field. $\vec\{\tau\}_L$ are the Pauli matrices.
$g'$ and $g$ are the $U(1)$ and $\mathrm\{SU\}(2)$ coupling constants.
$W^\{a\mu \nu\}$ and $B^\{\mu \nu\}$ are the field strength tensors for the
weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.

### Higgs

The Higgs Lagrangian before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_H = \varphi^\{\dagger\} \left ( \partial^\{\mu\} - \frac\{i\}\{2\} \left (g' Y_W B^\{\mu\} + g \vec\{\tau\} \vec\{W\}^\{\mu\} \right ) \right ) \left ( \partial_\{\mu\} + \frac\{i\}\{2\} \left ( g' Y_W B_\{\mu\} + g \vec\{\tau\}\vec\{W\}_\{\mu\} \right ) \right) \varphi - \frac\{\lambda^2\}\{4\} (\varphi^\{\dagger\} \varphi  - v^2)^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Yukawa

The portion of the Lagrangian for the Yukawa coupling is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{L\}_\{Yukawa\} = \bar\{U\}_L G_u U_R \varphi^0 - \bar\{D\}_L G_u U_R \varphi^\{-\} + \bar\{U\}_L G_d D_R \varphi^+ + \bar\{D\}_L G_d D_R \varphi^0 + hc
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $G_\{u,d\}$ are 3x3 matrices of Yukawa couplings.

## Symmetries

The standard model has symmetry group
$\mathrm\{SU\}(3) \times \mathrm\{SU\}(2) \times U(1)$. The colour group
$\mathrm\{SU\}(3)$ is the symmetry group for the strong interaction and
$\mathrm\{SU\}(2) \times \mathrm\{SU\}(1)$ for the electroweak interaction
spontaneously broken by the Higgs interaction.
