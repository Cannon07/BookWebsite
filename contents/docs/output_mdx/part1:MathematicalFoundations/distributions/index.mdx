Distributions are powerful generalizations of functions which arise
often when solving physical equations. We start with the intuitive
example of the Dirac delta and return to a more general discussions of
distributions.

## The Dirac Delta

Informally defined, the Dirac delta is a function which satisfies the
following equation. $$\delta(x) = \begin\{cases\}
+\infty, & x = 0 \\
0, & x \neq 0 \\
\end\{cases\}$$ This \"function\" $\delta$ is also constrained to obey the
following equation. $$\int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} \delta(x) dx = 1$$ The
issue here of course is that there exists no such function on
$\mathbb\{R\}$ since functions can't take the value of $\infty$. The Dirac
delta is thus an example of a *distribution*, a type of generalized
function. Before we provide formal definitions, it will be useful to
create a little more structured definition of the Dirac delta. Let's
first start with introducing a simple integral we will find useful

$$d_K(x) = \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} e^\{ikx\} dk$$

How can we solve this complex integral? Recall the formula

$$e^\{ikx\} = \cos(kx) + i \sin(kx)$$

and rewrite $$\begin\{aligned\}
    d_K(x) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} e^\{ikx\} dk \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} \cos(kx) + i \sin(kx) dk \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} \cos(kx)  dk + \frac\{i\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} \sin(kx) dk\\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \frac\{\sin(kx)\}\{kx\} \Big|^\{K/2\}_\{-K/2\} - \frac\{i\}\{2\pi\}  \frac\{\cos(kx)\}\{kx\} \Big |_\{-K/2\}^\{K/2\} \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

To evaluate the last expression, note that $\cos$ is an even function
and that $\sin$ is an odd function so we gain

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    d_K(x) &= \frac\{1\}\{\pi x\} \sin\{\frac\{Kx\}\{2\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

These functions spike at the origin with the spike growing more
pronounced as $K \to \infty$ as the plot below shows

$d_\{50\}$.](figures/Mathematical Foundations/distributions/distributions_d_50.png)\{#fig:d_K\}

$d_K(x)$ is damped by the factor $\frac\{1\}\{\pi x\}$ the further you get
from the origin. Note that formally, $d_K(0)$ is undefined, but we can
evaluate a reasonable value at the origin, by using L'HÃ´pital's rule

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    d_K(0) &:= \lim_\{x \to 0\} \frac\{\sin\{\tfrac\{Kx\}\{2\}\}\}\{\pi x\} \\
    &= \lim_\{x \to 0\} \frac\{\tfrac\{K\}\{2\}\cos\{\tfrac\{Kx\}\{2\}\}\}\{\pi\} \\
    &= \frac\{K\}\{2\pi\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The definite integral of $d_K(x)$ over the real line equals $1$ for all
$K$. To show this, consider the following definite integral

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} d_K(x) dx &= \int_\{\infty\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{1\}\{\pi x\} \sin \tfrac\{Kx\}\{2\}  dx\\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{\sin\{\tfrac\{Kx\}\{2\}\}\}\{x\} dx \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's perform the substitution $y=\frac\{Kx\}\{2\}$. Then
$x = \frac\{2y\}\{K\}$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{\sin\{\tfrac\{Kx\}\{2\}\}\}\{x\} dx
    &= \frac\{1\}\{\pi\}\frac\{2\}\{K\} \frac\{K\}\{2\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{\sin\{y\}\}\{y\} dy \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{\pi\}\int_\{-\infty\} ^ \{\infty\} \frac\{\sin(y)\}\{y\} dy \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{\pi\}\pi \\
    &= 1
\end\{aligned\}$$

This behavior suggests the following formal definition of $\delta$

$$\delta(x) = \lim_\{K \to \infty\} d_K(x)$$

The mathematicians in the audience might ask, well, what's the meaning
of this limit? Is it pointwise? Is it convergence in an operator norm?
We won't dig into these mathematical details just yet. Instead, we will
note that physicists like to express this limit evocatively with the
following definition

$$\delta(x) = \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{ikx\} dk$$

The advantage of this definition is that it proves much more amenable to
symbolic manipulation.

## Distributions \{#distributions\}

As the Dirac delta shows, there are interesting function-like objects
which don't fit neatly into the standard definition of a function. Let's
generalize from the intuitive notion of a Dirac delta to a more robust
mathematical definition. It's possible to meaningfully integrate the
Dirac delta against functions by using the limit definition with $d_K$
above. The formal notion of a distribution builds on this intuition and
defines a distribution as continuous linear functions on a space of
suitable functions.

The space in question is called a Schwartz space and is usually denoted
as $\mathcal\{S\}$. The Schwartz space, roughly speaking, is the set of
infinitely differentiable functions which rapidly shrink to $0s$. You
can think of a function in this space as being \"nearly finite.\"

To define Schwartz spaces more rigorously, we need to introduce a few
basic concepts from the field of topology. A closed subset of
$\mathbb\{R\}^n$ is one which contains all its limit points. A compact
subset of $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ is a subset which is closed and bounded.

Let $C^\{\infty\}(U)$ define the space of all infinitely differentiable
functions on $U$, where $U$ is a subset of $R^n$. $C^\{\infty\}_c(U)$ is
the subset of functions which have compact support. That is, if
$f \in C^\{\infty\}_c(U)$, there exists some compact subset $K$ of $U$
such that $f$ is only nonzero on $K$.

We say that $T: C^\{\infty\}_c(U) \to \mathbb\{R\}$ is a linear function if
$T$ is a linear function. A linear function $T$ on $C^\{\infty\}_c(U)$ is
a distribution with $T$ is continuous.

Note that we don't define here what continuity would mean on
$C^\{\infty\}_c(U)$. Defining a proper notion of continuity on a space can
get involved, but intuitively, continuity means the same thing
(functions that are close to one another get mapped to close points by
$T$).
