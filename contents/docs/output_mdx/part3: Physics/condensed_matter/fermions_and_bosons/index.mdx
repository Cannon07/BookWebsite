# Fermions and Bosons

Particles come in two fundamental types, fermions and bosons. These two
particles are differentiated by whether they obey the Pauli exclusion
principle, which states that two particles with half-integer spins
cannot occupy the same quantum state.

## Statistics of Particles

As we briefly mentioned, fermions and bosons obey different statistical
properties.

### Bose-Einstein Statistics

Bosons are indistinguishable from one-another and can occupy the same
energy state. The probability density collection for a set of bosons is
given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
f(E_i) = \frac\{g_i\}\{e^\{(E_i - \mu)/k_BT\} - 1\},
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $g_i$ is the degeneracy (the number of quantum
states that share the same energy level), $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant,
$E_i$ is the energy of the $i$-th possible state, $T$ is the absolute
temperature, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential. This equation can be
derived from the form of the grand canonical ensemble that we
encountered earlier in the book.

### Fermi-Dirac Statistics

The Fermi-Dirac statistics describe the distributions ion over energies
for an ensemble of particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle and
which is at thermal equilibrium. As a technical condition, these
particles have half integer spin and are called fermions. The energy
distribution is given by the following probability density function.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(E_i) = \frac\{1\}\{1 + e^\{(E_i - \mu)/k_BT\}\},
\end\{aligned\}$$

This formula can also be derived from the grand canonical ensemble.
Electrons are examples of fermions.
