In the previous chapter, we learned how to solve the Klein-Gordon
equation for simple free fields. Solving the Klein-Gordon equation for
more complex fields with potentials requires additional mathematical
infrastructure. In particular, we will make use of the Green's function.

## Defining the Green's Function

The Green's function for the Klein-Gordon equation is also commonly
called the propagator in quantum field theory. The Green's function is
defined as the solution to the following equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    -(\partial^2 + m^2)D(x) &= \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall that the Klein-Gordon equation is defined on Minkowski space,
where we define

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \partial^2 = \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_1^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_2^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_3^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$m \in \mathbb\{R\}$ is an arbitrary real number. Recall that the general
form of Green's functions is as distributions and not as functions so we
expect $D(x)$ to define a distribution and not a function. To solve the
equation above, we use the Fourier representation of the Dirac delta
function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \delta^\{(4)\}(x) = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$

As a first note, recall that $k,x  \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$ are elements of
Minkowski space. So the notation above is actually shorthand for

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    kx \equiv k_0 t - k_1 x_1 - k_2 x_2 - k_3 x_3
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall that the dirac delta $\delta^\{(4)\}(x)$ defines a functional and
is a distribution and not a function. So the integral on the right hand
side above should be read as defining a mapping

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    g(x) \mapsto \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$

To find a solution, as is often the case with differential equations, we
turn to exponential functions. Let's compute

$$\begin\{aligned\}
-(\partial^2 + m^2 ) e^\{ikx\} &= -\left (\frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_1^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_2^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_3^2\}  + m^2 \right ) e^\{i(k_0t - k_1x_1 - k_2x_2 - k_3x_3)\}  \\
&= -\left ((ik_0)^2e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_1)^2e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_2)^2 e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_3)^2 e^\{ikx\} + m^2 e^\{ikx\}\right ) \\
&= -((ik_0)^2 - (-ik_1)^2 - (-ik_2)^2  - (-ik_3)^2 +m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= -(-k_0^2 + k_1^2 + k_2^2  + k_3^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= -(-k^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= (k^2 - m^2)e^\{ikx\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, $e^\{ikx\}$ is an eigenfunction of the operator
$-(\partial^2 + m^2)$. We could then hypothesize that the Green's
function of the Klein-Gordon operator would be given by the following
\"function\".

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then, by applying the Klein-Gordon operator, we would
obtain, by differentiating through the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (-\partial^2 + m^2) \left [ \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2\} d^4 k \right ] &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{-(\partial^2 +m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2\} d^4 k \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2\} d^4 k  \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k \\
    &= \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This calculation works almost everywhere. The exception
is at those points where $k^2 = m^2$. Expanding out the equation, this
is the surface of points $$\begin\{aligned\}
    k_0^2 - k_1^2 - k_2^2 - k_3^3 = m^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ Such a surface is vanishingly small compared to the
entirety of $\mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$. We know that for point singularities, it
is sometimes possible to complete the function by taking a limit. The
limit completion technique used for this function is called the
$(i\varepsilon)$ prescription. The idea is to prevent the singularity on
the surface $k^2 = m^2$ by adding a small nonzero value, the
$i\varepsilon$. That is, we define the distribution $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2 + i\epsilon\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ How are we to interpret this expression? It's easiest to
concretely represent the expression as a mapping $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g(x) \mapsto \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon\} g(x) d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us now apply the Klein-Gordon operator to this
distribution by differentiating through the integral sign and through
the limit $$\begin\{aligned\}
    &= (-\partial^2 + m^2) \left [ \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i \varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k\right ] \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(-\partial^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4 k \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2 - m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4 k \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ We claim that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k &= \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4k
\end\{aligned\}$$

It then follows that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} d^4 k = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k = \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ holds as an equality of distributions.

We see in these manipulations, the $g(x)$ term is just carried around.
From now on, when performing manipulations with distributions, we will
often not show the \"test function\" $g(x)$ and the limit explicitly,
but will just perform manipulations directly. If you are confused about
how an operation is valid, write out the test function and limit in full
detail to convince yourself.

## Exercises

1.  For a given test function $g$, prove that $$\begin\{aligned\}
        \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k &= \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4k
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ State the assumptions about $g$ that you make to
    prove this statement.

2.  Prove that $$\begin\{aligned\}
        \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} d^4 k = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4 k = \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ holds as a limit in the topology of distributions.

Gauge theories arise in quantum field theories that obey a local
symmetry that is position dependent. In this chapter, we introduce the
basics of gauge theories.

## The XY Model

The XY model provides a toy example of a gauge theory. This model is an
example of what is called a *nonlinear sigma model* and involves a
$O(N)$ isovector $n$ with unit length which has the $O(N)$ invariant
interaction

$$\begin\{aligned\}
Z(K) = \int \prod_r dn(r) \exp \Bigg [ K \sum_\{\langle r, r' \rangle\} n(r) \cdot n(r') \Bigg ], \qquad |n| = 1
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\langle r, r' \rangle$ means that $r$, $r'$ are nearest neighbors
in a lattice. We can write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    n(r) = i \cos \theta(r) + j \sin \theta(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we assume that we operate in two dimensions. We
define the correlation function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
G_\{\alpha\beta\}(r - r') &= \langle e^\{i\alpha \theta(r)\} e^\{i\beta \theta(r')\} \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

The invariance that this theory satisfies is $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta(r) \mapsto \mathcal\{S\}(\theta(r)) = \theta(r) + \theta_0, \quad \forall r
\end\{aligned\}$$

## $\mathcal\{Z\}_2$ Gauge theory in two dimensions

Consider a square lattice.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z(K) = \sum_s \Bigg [ K \sum_\{\square\} s_i s_j s_k s_l \Bigg ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $\square$ denotes squares in the lattice. Ising
variables are placed on bonds in the lattice. Note that reversing all
spins

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    s_i \mapsto -s_i
\end\{aligned\}$$ preserves the model. Note that this model also satisfies
a local symmetry when we only flip the spins $B(r)$ that adjoin the
lattice point. This means that products of spins around closed loops
will survive the gauge transformation (since 2 or 0 will flip).

In this chapter, we introduce the basics of Feynman diagrams, a powerful
technology for modeling relativistic quantum processes. Feynman diagrams
provide conceptual models for complex interacting quantum processes. In
this chapter we introduce the basic theory of Feynman diagrams and
Feynman rules as a mathematical technique for evaluating integrals
before briefly explaining how these techniques can be used for more
complex physical systems.

## Feynman Diagrams for Evaluating Integrals

In this section, we use Feynman diagrams to evaluate an integral.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + b q^4 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

The presence of the quartic term means that we can't directly evaluate
this integral using techniques we've developed for evaluating Gaussian
integrals. One possibility for removing the quartic term is to expand it
out as a Taylor series:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    e^\{bq^4\} &= 1 + bq^4 + \frac\{b^2q^8\}\{2!\} + \frac\{b^2q^\{12\}\}\{3!\} + \dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$

Plugging this expansion back into the earlier expression yield

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + b q^4 + cq\} dq
    &= \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + cq\} \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n q^\{4n\}\}\{n!\} \right ] dq \\
    &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} q^\{4n\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$ We note that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dc\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= q e^\{aq^2 + cq\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Repeating the derivative, we obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d^2\}\{dc\} d^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= \frac\{d\}\{dc\} (qe^\{aq^2 + cq\}) \\
    &= q \frac\{d\}\{dc\} (e^\{aq^2 + cq\}) \\
    &= q^2 e^\{aq^2 + cq\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ We see now that we can iterate as many times as desired
to obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= q^\{4n\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then differentiate through the integral sign
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} q^\{4n\}e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

Returning to the expression above, we obtain that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + bq^4 + cq\} dq &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\}\left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n\right ] \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

Note that above, we are treating $\frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}$ as an linear
operator and taking its exponential. To tackle the inner integral, we
complete the square in the exponential. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a\left (q^2 + \frac\{c\}\{a\}q + \frac\{c^2\}\{4a^2\}\right ) - \frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} dq \\
    &= e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}\int_\{-\infty\}^\infty e^\{a\left (q + \frac\{c\}\{2a\}\right )^2 \} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$ We apply the change of variable $r = q + \frac\{c\}\{2a\}$.
Note then that $dr = dq$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &=
    e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{ar^2\} dr
\end\{aligned\}$$ Applying the formula for the Gaussian integral we obtain
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{ar^2\} dr &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ It follows that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We then substitute this expression into the earlier
operator evaluation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \left [ e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}  \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's pause here and take stock of what we've achieved.
We've rewritten our original integral as the application of a linear
operator in $c$, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}e^\{b\frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\},
\end\{aligned\}$$ to a function in $c$, $e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}$. What's the
advantage of this representation? Computing this quantity outright isn't
straightforward. However, we have two exponential quantities, and we can
expand both as power series to obtain a representation of $Z$ as a power
series in two indices $n$, $m$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\} \right )^n \right ] \left [
     \sum_\{m=0\}^\infty \frac\{\left(-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\} \right )^m\}\{m!\} \right ] \\
     &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \sum_\{m=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n(-1)^m\}\{n!m!(4a)^m\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n c^\{2m\} \\
     &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \sum_\{m=0\}^\{\infty\} Z_\{n,m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we define intermediate quantities $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{n, m\} &= \frac\{b^n(-1)^m\}\{n!m!(4a)^m\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n c^\{2m\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that these $Z_\{n,m\}$ are no longer functions and
are numbers! For example, we take $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{3, 2\} &= \frac\{b^3\}\{3!2!(4a)^2\} \frac\{d^\{12\}\}\{dc^\{12\}\} c^4 \\
    &= \frac\{b^3\}\{3!2!4^2 a^2\} (4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \dotsc \cdot -8) \frac\{1\}\{c^8\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ While we don't have an analytical expression for $Z$, we
can evaluate any $Z_\{n,m\}$ term. We can then do a series expansion out
to any $N$, $M$ we desire as follows: $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \tilde\{Z\} &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}\sum_\{n=0\}^N \sum_\{m=0\}^M Z_\{n,m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Each $Z_\{n, m\}$ can be viewed as a combinatorial object in its own
right. To understand what this means, consider the manipulations

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{1, 4\} &= \frac\{b(-1)^4\}\{4!4^4a^4\} \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\} c^8 \\ 
    &= \frac\{b(-1)^4\}\{4!4^4a^4\} (8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5) c^4 \\
    &= \frac\{8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5\}\{4!4^4\} \frac\{(-1)^4bc^4\}\{a^4\} \\
    &= \binom\{8\}\{4\} \frac\{(-1)^4bc^4\}\{4^4a^4 \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The presence of the choose operation suggests that there
are discrete objects underlying $Z_\{n,m\}$. What could these objects be?
Let's start by looking at the coefficients for $a$, $b$, $c$. Note that
$Z_\{1,4\}$ contains $b$, $\frac\{1\}\{a^4\}$, $c^4$ as its coefficient
powers. Can we construct a discrete object that contains these
coefficients? For example, consider the following diagram.\

Here we have two lines intersecting at a vertex. The inputs to the lines
are labeled with $c$ coefficients. The vertex is labeled with $b$
coefficients and the line segments with $\frac\{1\}\{a\}$ coefficients. If
we multiply all these coefficients, we can consider them as contributing
a term $\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$. More abstractly, we can think of $Z_\{1,4\}$ as
counting contributions from all diagrams which are made of 4 lines and
one vertex. For example, consider this alternative diagram where there
is a loop at the vertex and one line as an unconnected component. Note
that this diagram contributes the same term $\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$.\

We can view these simple diagrams as simple Feynman diagrams for our
system. By enumerating all the diagrams that provide a term
$\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$ according to our rules, we could obtain the
coefficient for this term in our power series. We know from the
calculation above that the coefficient is $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{8 \choose 4\}\frac\{(-1)^4\}\{4^4\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We leave as an exercise for the reader how to obtain
this coefficient from the two diagrams above.

## Exercises

1.  Evaluate the term $Z_\{4, 3\}$ for $a=-3$, $b=2$, $c=1$.

2.  Derive a double series expansion for the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
        Z = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{-aq^2 + bq^7 + cq\} dq
    \end\{aligned\}$$

Feynman diagrams arise as a tool to organize complex perturbative
calculations arising in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. In
particular, we can view Feynman diagrams as indexing terms in the Dyson
series.

Wick's theorem provides the mathematical basis for the perturbative
expansion that underpins Feynman diagrams.

## Normal Ordering

A product of quantum fields is said to be normal ordered if all creation
operators are to the left of all annihilation operators. If a product of
operators is denoted by $O$, the normal-ordering of this product is
denoted $:O:$. To give a few examples, $$\begin\{aligned\}
    :\hat\{a\}^\dagger \hat\{a\}: &= \hat\{a\}^\dagger \hat\{a\}\\
    :\hat\{a\} \hat\{a\}^\dagger: &= \hat\{a\}^\dagger \hat\{a\}\\    
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\hat\{a\}^\dagger$ is a creation operator and
$\hat\{a\}$ is an annihilation operator.

## Wick's Theorem

Wick's theorem is a tool for simplifying the computation of a higher
order derivative into a combinatorial sum of lower order terms.

We define the contraction of an operator to be the difference between
the product and the normal form of the product $$\begin\{aligned\}
\contraction\{\}\{A\}\{\}\{B\} AB &= AB - :AB:
\end\{aligned\}$$

The general statement is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    ABCDEF\dotsc &= :ABCDEF \dotsc : + \sum_\{\textrm\{single contractions\}\} :\contraction\{\}\{A\}\{\}\{B\} ABCDEF\dotsc : \
    &+ \sum_\{\textrm\{double contractions\}\} :\contraction\{\}\{A\}\{\}\{B\}
    \contraction\{A\}\{B\}\{\}\{C\}
    ABCDEF\dotsc : + \dotsc 
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Proof Sketch

Let us consider the $N=2$ case of Wick's theorem. In this case, the
formula simplifies to $$\begin\{aligned\}
    AB &= :AB: + :\contraction\{\}\{A\}\{\}\{B\} AB:
\end\{aligned\}$$ This statement is true by definition. To prove the more
general form, we proceed by induction. The new operator we add for the
$N$ operator case must either be a creation or annihiliation operator.
We can simplify on these two cases using the inductive assumption.

## An Alternative Formulation

Suppose that we have $N$ real random variables that form a vector

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    |X\rangle &= [x_1,\dotsc,x_n],\quad x_i \in \mathbb\{R\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We define a partition function over these variables by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z(J) &= \prod_\{i=1\}^N \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} dx_i e^\{-S_0(X) + \langle J | X \rangle\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $J$ is a source field vector $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |J\rangle &= [J_1, \dotsc, J_n] \\
    \langle J | X \rangle &= \sum_\{i=1\}^N J_i x_i
\end\{aligned\}$$ Recall that for a $1$-dimensional example, we have the
Gaussian integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{-\frac\{1\}\{2\}mx^2 + Jx\} &= \sqrt\{\frac\{2\pi\}\{m\}\} \exp \Bigg [ \frac\{J^2\}\{2m\} \Bigg ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's now consider the matrix action $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S(J) &= -\frac\{1\}\{2\}\langle X | M | X \rangle + \langle J | X \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here let $M$ be a real symmetric matrix that has
orthonormal eigen vectors $$\begin\{aligned\}
    M|\alpha \rangle &= m_\{\alpha\}|\alpha \rangle \\
    \langle \alpha | \beta \rangle &= \delta_\{ab\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can expand vectors $|X\rangle$ and $|J\rangle$ in
terms of this orthonormal basis $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |X\rangle &= \sum_\{\alpha\}x_\alpha |\alpha \rangle \\
    |J\rangle &= \sum_\{\alpha\}J_\alpha |\alpha \rangle \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ These two equations mean that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle J | X \rangle &= \sum_\{\alpha\}J_\alpha x_\alpha
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since the mapping $x_i \mapsto x_\alpha$ is orthogonal, the jacobian
$\mathcal\{J\}$ is identity. We can rewrite the action $S$ now as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    S(J) &= -\frac\{1\}\{2\}\langle X | M | X \rangle + \langle J | X \rangle \\
    &= \sum_\{\alpha\} \left ( -\frac\{1\}\{2\}x_\alpha^2m_\alpha + J_\alpha x_\{\alpha\} \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can now factor the partition function into a producct
of Gaussian integrals $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z(J) &= \prod_\{i=1\}^N \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{-S(J)\} \\
    &= \prod_\{\alpha\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} dx_\alpha \exp \Bigg [ \sum_\{\alpha\} \left ( -\frac\{1\}\{2\}m_\alpha x_\alpha^2 + J_\alpha x_\alpha \right ) \Bigg ] \\
    &= \prod_\{\alpha\} \left ( \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} dx_\{\alpha\} \exp \Bigg [ -\frac\{1\}\{2\}m_\alpha x_\alpha^2 + J_\alpha x_\alpha \Bigg ] \right ) \\
    &= \prod_\{\alpha\} \sqrt\{\frac\{2\pi\}\{m_\alpha\}\} e^\{\frac\{\frac\{1\}\{2\}J_\alpha\frac\{1\}\{m_\alpha\}J_\alpha\}\{2m_\{\alpha\}\}\} \\
    &= \frac\{(2\pi)^\{N/2\}\}\{\sqrt\{\det M\}\} e^\{\frac\{1\}\{2\}\langle J | M^\{-1\}| J \rangle\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Isserlis' Theorem

Isserlis' Theorem is the statistical mechanical analogue of Wick's
theorem and provides a way to compute expectations of products of
multivariate normals. Let $$\begin\{aligned\}
(X_1,\dotsc, X_n) \in \mathcal\{N\}(\vec\{0\}, \Sigma)
\end\{aligned\}$$ be a zero mean multivariate normal. Then we can compute
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E[X_1\dotsc X_n] &= \sum_\{p \in P^2_n\} \prod_\{(i,j) \in p\}  E[X_i X_j]
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $p$ is a pairing of $\{1,\dotsc, n\}$ into pairs
and $P^2_n$ is the set of all such pairs.

## Feynman Diagrams

Consider an expression of the form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle 0 | \mathcal\{T\}\{\phi_I(x_1)\dotsc \phi_I(x_n)\}|0 \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can apply Wick's theorem to the case where $n=4$ to
represent it as the sum of three diagrams. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle 0 | \mathcal\{T\} \{\phi_1\phi_2\phi_3\phi_4\}|0 \rangle &= 
\begin\{tikzpicture\}[baseline=\{([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)\}]
\node[main] (1) \{$1$\}; 
\node[main] (2) [below of=1] \{$3$\};
\node[main] (3) [right of=1] \{$2$\};
\node[main] (4) [below of=3] \{$4$\};
\draw (1) -- (2);
\draw (3) -- (4);
\end\{tikzpicture\}
+
\begin\{tikzpicture\}[baseline=\{([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)\}]
\node[main] (1) \{$1$\}; 
\node[main] (2) [right of=1] \{$2$\};
\node[main] (3) [below of=1] \{$2$\};
\node[main] (4) [below of=2] \{$4$\};
\draw (1) -- (2);
\draw (3) -- (4);
\end\{tikzpicture\}
+
\begin\{tikzpicture\}[baseline=\{([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)\}]
\node[main] (1) \{$1$\}; 
\node[main] (2) [right of=1] \{$2$\};
\node[main] (3) [below of=1] \{$2$\};
\node[main] (4) [below of=2] \{$4$\};
\draw (1) -- (4);
\draw (3) -- (2);
\end\{tikzpicture\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Physically, these expressions are usually interpreted as
particles being created and annihilated at vertices. This intuition is
often very useful, but we will also find it useful to view Feynman
diagrams as purely combinatorial constructs as well.

Renormalization provides systematic tools for handling the infinities
that arise in Feynman integrals. The renormalization group provides a
structured method for looking at a physical system at multiple length
scales and serves as a structural explanation of the techniques that
arise in renormalization. The mathematical tools of the renormalization
group come up in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory in
particular.

## Renormalization

There exist a number of methods to systematically cancel the infinities
by the introduction of counterterms. Such counterterms are closely tied
to the regularization methods that we learned about in the previous
chapter, with counterterms typically dependent on the cutoff parameter
$\Lambda$. In this section, we briefly survey such infinities.

### On-shell Scheme

In the on-shell renormalization scheme, parameters in the Lagrangian are
replaced with "physical" parameters that are set by reference to
experimental data.

### Minimal Subtraction Scheme

The minimal subtraction scheme follows a similar procedure, but only
absorbs divergent terms into the counterterms.

## Basic Formulation of Renormalization Group

Suppose that we have state variables $\{s_i\}$ and coupling constants
$\{J_k\}$. Let us suppose the system state is then defined by a
Hamiltonian $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H(\{s_i\}, \{J_k\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ Suppose then that we have a transformation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{s_i\} \mapsto \{\tilde\{s_i\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |\{s_i\}| > |\{\tilde\{s\}_i\}|
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, the transformation shrinks the number of state
variables. If we have a function $\beta$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \beta(\{Z_k\}) = \{\tilde\{Z\}_k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H(\{s_i\}, \{Z_k\}) = H(\{\tilde\{s\}_i\}, \{\tilde\{Z\}_k\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ then we say that the system is renormalizable.

Many observable quantities in quantum field theory lead to infinite
quantities. Regularization is a family of techniques used to control
these infinities through the use of a finite quantity called the
regulator.

## Pauli-Villars Regularization

This technique introduces a fictitious mass term into integrals.
Consider the photon propagator in momentum space $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{k^2 + i \epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This propagator is replaced by the propagator
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{k^2 + i\epsilon\} - \frac\{1\}\{k^2 - \Lambda^2 + i\epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $\Lambda$ is viewed as a fictitious heavy mass.

## Dimensional Regularization

Dimensional regularization writes a Feynman integral as a function that
depends on the spacetime dimension $d$. By assuming that dimension is a
continuous complex variable, the function can be analytically continued
to all of the complex plane, including at points at which the original
integral was singular. The value of this analytic continuation is used
as a reasonable proxy for the originally singular integral.

Consider the following loop integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int \frac\{d^4 p\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \frac\{1\}\{(p^2 + m^2)^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here the integral is explicitly set for $d=4$. We
rewrite this integral to be in terms of $d$ explicitly $$\begin\{aligned\}
\int \frac\{d^d p\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \frac\{1\}\{(p^2 + m^2)^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ If the function $f$ only depends on $p^2$, then we have
the radial identity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int d^d p f(p^2) &= \frac\{(2\pi)^\{d/2\}\}\{\Gamma(d/2)\} \int_0^\infty p^\{d-1\} f(p^2)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us consider the case where $d = 4 - \epsilon$ where
$\epsilon$ is considered to be a small quantity. Then we can evaluate
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{(2\pi)^\{(4-\epsilon)/2\}\}\{\Gamma(\frac\{4 - \epsilon\}\{2\})\} \int_0^\infty \frac\{d^\{4-\epsilon\}p\}\{(2\pi)^\{4-\epsilon\}\} \frac\{p^\{3-\epsilon\}\}\{(p^2 +m^2)^2 \} &= \frac\{2^\{\epsilon - 4\}\pi^\{\epsilon/2 -1\}\}\{\sin(\frac\{\pi \epsilon\}\{2\}\Gamma(1 - \epsilon/2)\} m^\{-\epsilon\} \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{8\pi^2\epsilon\} - \frac\{1\}\{16\pi^2\} \left (\ln \frac\{m^2\}\{4\pi\} _ \gamma \right ) + O(\epsilon)
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Zeta Function Regularization

Sometimes we have energy quantities of the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \sum_m \frac\{\hbar |\omega_n|\}\{2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ If $\omega_n$ doesn't decay fast enough, this sum will
diverge. We can instead choose to evaluate the quantity
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \sum_m \frac\{\hbar |\omega_n|\}\{2\}|\omega_n|^\{-s\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

In previous chapters, we've introduced you to the fundamental forces
that govern all known physics: the electromagnetic, weak, strong, and
gravitational forces. A major goal of modern physics is to unify all
these forces into one theory that describes all known physics. For the
present, such a goal is beyond the reach of modern physics, but
researchers have achieved considerable success in unifying three of the
known forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces) into one unified
theory called the standard model.

In many ways the standard model represents the frontier of known
physics. It has been extensively experimentally tested and produced
extraordinarily accurate predictions. It is also fundamentally limited,
not being capable of explaining gravity.

## The Standard Model Lagrangian

Mathematically, the standard model builds on the machinery of quantum
field theory we've introduced earlier in the book. In particular, the
standard model is defined by a standard Lagrangian that describes the
associated field theory. We will introduce this Lagrangian by writing
down the components of the Lagrangian that correspond to different
forces and interactionns.

### Quantum Chromodynamics

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_\{QCD\} = \sum_\{\psi\} \bar\{\psi\}_i (i\gamma^\{\mu\}(\partial_\{\mu\} \delta_\{ij\} - i g_s G_\{\mu\}^aT_\{ij\}^a)) \psi_j - \frac\{1\}\{4\} G_\{\mu\nu\}^a G^\{\mu\nu\}_a
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Electroweak Force

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_\{EW\} = \sum_\{\psi\} \bar\{\psi\} \gamma^\{\mu\} \left ( i \partial_\mu - g' \frac\{1\}\{2\} Y_W B_\{\mu\} - g \frac\{1\}\{2\} \vec\{\tau\}_L \vec\{W\}_\{\mu\} \right ) \psi -\frac\{1\}\{4\} W_\{\mu\nu\}^a W^a_\{\mu\nu\} - \frac\{1\}\{4\} B^\{\mu \nu\} B_\{\mu \nu\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where $B_\{\mu\}$ is a U(1) gauge field. $Y_W$ is the weak hypercharge,
the generator of the $U(1)$ group. $\vec\{W\}_\{\mu\}$ is the 3-component
$\mathrm\{SU\}(2)$ gauge field. $\vec\{\tau\}_L$ are the Pauli matrices.
$g'$ and $g$ are the $U(1)$ and $\mathrm\{SU\}(2)$ coupling constants.
$W^\{a\mu \nu\}$ and $B^\{\mu \nu\}$ are the field strength tensors for the
weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.

### Higgs

The Higgs Lagrangian before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}_H = \varphi^\{\dagger\} \left ( \partial^\{\mu\} - \frac\{i\}\{2\} \left (g' Y_W B^\{\mu\} + g \vec\{\tau\} \vec\{W\}^\{\mu\} \right ) \right ) \left ( \partial_\{\mu\} + \frac\{i\}\{2\} \left ( g' Y_W B_\{\mu\} + g \vec\{\tau\}\vec\{W\}_\{\mu\} \right ) \right) \varphi - \frac\{\lambda^2\}\{4\} (\varphi^\{\dagger\} \varphi  - v^2)^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Yukawa

The portion of the Lagrangian for the Yukawa coupling is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{L\}_\{Yukawa\} = \bar\{U\}_L G_u U_R \varphi^0 - \bar\{D\}_L G_u U_R \varphi^\{-\} + \bar\{U\}_L G_d D_R \varphi^+ + \bar\{D\}_L G_d D_R \varphi^0 + hc
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $G_\{u,d\}$ are 3x3 matrices of Yukawa couplings.

## Symmetries

The standard model has symmetry group
$\mathrm\{SU\}(3) \times \mathrm\{SU\}(2) \times U(1)$. The colour group
$\mathrm\{SU\}(3)$ is the symmetry group for the strong interaction and
$\mathrm\{SU\}(2) \times \mathrm\{SU\}(1)$ for the electroweak interaction
spontaneously broken by the Higgs interaction.


# An Introduction to Interacting Fields \{#chap:perturbative_expansion\}

The quantum fields we have considered till now have all been free,
without interactions. In this chapter, we will study the basics of how
to study interacting field theory. Mathematically, interacting field
theory is considerably more complex than free field theory since the
product of operator valued distributions is not defined in general.

## Dyson's Formula

Suppose that we have a Hamiltonian split into a free part and an
interaction part $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= H_0 + V_S(t)
\end\{aligned\}$$ The interaction picture of quantum mechanics defines the
quantity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    V_I(t) &= e^\{iH_0(t-t_0)\}V_S(t)e^\{-iH_0(t-t_0)\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Suppose we write the update operator as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t) &= U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This operator is called the Dyson operator. This
operator satisfies a few properties

-   Identity $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U(t, t) &= I
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Composition $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U(t, t_0) &= U(t, t_1) U(t_1, t_0)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Time Reversal $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U^\{-1\}(t, t_0) &= U(t_0, t)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Unitarity $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U^\dagger(t, t_0) U(t, t_0) &= 1
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

We state but don't prove the fact that these properties imply the
following $$\begin\{aligned\}
    i\frac\{d\}\{dt\}U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0) &= V(t)U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This defines an integral equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= 1 - i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) U(t_1, t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This equation can be iterated to solve $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= 1 - i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) U(t_1, t_0) \\
    &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1)\left (1 - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} V(t_2)U(t_2, t_0) \right ) \\
     &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_2\} V(t_1)V(t_2)U(t_2, t_0)  \\
    %&= \dotsc \\
    &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_2\} V(t_1)V(t_2) - \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\}\int^\{t_2\}_\{t_0\} \int^\{t_3\}_\{t_0\} V(t_1)V(t_2)V(t_3) + \dotsc 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note the condition we have that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    t_1 > t_2 > \dotsc > t_n
\end\{aligned\}$$ We define the time ordering operator which reorders its
arguments to be in descending time order. Now let us define the terms
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    U_n &= (-i)^n \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \dotsc \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_n\} \mathcal\{T\} V(t_1)\dotsc V(t_n)
\end\{aligned\}$$ By noting the symmetry of the system, we can simplify
the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U_n &= \frac\{(-i)^n\}\{n!\} \int_\{t_0\}^t \dotsc \int_\{t_0\}^t \mathcal\{T\} V(t_1)\dotsc V(T_n)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We now have the expansion $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty U_n \\
    &= \mathcal\{T\} \exp \left ( -i \int_\{t_0\}^t V(\tau) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is typically referred to as Dyson's Formula.

## The $S$-Matrix

We define the $S$-matrix by the formula $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= \lim_\{t_2 \to \infty\} \lim_\{t_1 \to -\infty\} U(t_2, t_1)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using Dyson's formula, we can write the $S$-matrix as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= \mathcal\{T\} \exp \left ( -i \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty V(\tau) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us call the $n$-th term of the exponential's Taylor
expansion $S_n$. The Feynman diagrams can be viewed as constituent terms
in $S_n$

## Perturbative Expansion of Correlation Functions

In this section we will introduce perturbation theory for quantum
fields. In particular, we will compute the quantity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle \Omega | \mathcal\{T\}\phi(x)\phi(y) | \Omega \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ for the $\phi^4$ interacting theory. Note that this is
the simplest theory which isn't directly solvable as a Gaussian
integral. Here $|\Omega\rangle$ is the ground state of the interacting
theory. Recall that for the free theory, the same interaction function
is simply given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle 0 | \mathcal\{T\} \phi(x) \phi(y) | 0 \rangle_\{\textrm\{free\}\} &= D_F(x-y) \\
    &= \int \frac\{d^4p\}\{(2\pi)^4\}\frac\{ie^\{-ip\cdot(x-y)\}\}\{p^2-m^2+i\epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Recall that this is an equality of distributions and not
of functions.

The Hamiltonian for the $\phi^4$ theory is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= H_0 + H_\{\textrm\{int\}\} \\
    &= H_\{\textrm\{Klein-Gordon\}\} + \int d^3 x \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\} \phi^4(x) 
\end\{aligned\}$$ The basic strategy in perturbation theory is to
construct a power series for the correlation function in terms of
parameter $\lambda$.

## $\varphi^4$-Theory

The simplest interacting field theory that we will consider is
$\varphi^4$-theory which adds a quartic interaction term to the
Klein-Gordon Lagrangian

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}(\varphi) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\}[\partial^\mu \varphi \partial \varphi - m^2 \varphi^2] - \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\}\varphi^4
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Higher Order Interaction Terms

We can use Wick's theorem to reduce higher order interaction terms to
pairwise interaction terms.

Lattice quantum field theories study field theories defined on a
lattice. Lattice quantum field theories have the powerful advantage that
they describe mathematicaly well-defined objects (unlike most standard
quantum field theories), but with the major disadvantage that it is not
know if solutions to a lattice quantum field theory converge to the
correct continuum solution in all cases.

Quantum field theory builds machinery to handle relativistic quantum
mechanical systems with an unbounded number of particles. This chapter
will introduce considerable mathematical machinery, but we will aim to
motivate this machinery by tying back to examples you've already studied
at depth through this book.

## Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

The standard form of Schrodinger's equation we have seen thus far is not
relativistically invariant. Quantum field theory arose from attempts to
modify Schrodinger's equation to become relativistically invariant by
modifying the base form of Schrodinger's equation to respect Lorentz
invariance. The Klein-Gordon equation provides a simple first
relativistically invariant variant of Schrodinger's equation for
spinless particles without interactions.

The Dirac equation extends the base Klein-Gordon equation to add spin,
necessary to model particles such as electrons, but requires the
introduction of more sophisticated machinery in terms of spinors. We
will return to this equation shortly.

## Quantum Field Theory

The basic idea of second quantization is that fields themselves need to
be promoted to operator quantities in order to model quantum
field-theoretic systems. This is called second quantization as opposed
to first quantization, which is the procedure used for classical
quantities like position and momentum.

## Quantum Field Theory as a Physical Theory

States $\mathcal\{S\}$ are given by Hilbert space $\mathcal\{H\}$ of wave
functions as we saw earlier for quantum mechanics, but we will need to
use a larger Hilbert space. In particular, we will choose the Fock
space. Let's quickly motivate this construction. The suitable Hilbert
space for particle is $\mathcal\{H\} = L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^3)$. The Hilbert
space for $n$ particles is the tensor product $\mathcal\{H\}^\{\otimes n\}$.
Let $S_+$ be the tensor symmetrization operator. Then the bosonic Fock
space is

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 F_+(\mathcal\{H\}) = \overline\{\bigoplus_\{n=0\}^\infty S_+(\mathcal\{H\}^\{\otimes n\}\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The bar above indicates the Hilbert space completion. This definition is
a little complicated to digest, but you can think of it as allowing for
quantum states of arbitrarily many particles.

What then is a field? In mathematical language, a field $\phi$ is an
operator-valued distribution defined on $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$. That is,
$\phi$ maps functions in $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$ to operators. If we squint
we can pretend that points in $\mathbb\{R\}^3$ are points in
$F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$. (Pretend the Dirac delta $\delta_x$ at
$x \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is in $\mathcal\{H\} = L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^n)$. Then the
field $\phi$ maps $\delta_x$ to an operator. That is, there is an
operator for every point of space!)

For symmetries $\mathcal\{G\}$, unlike in nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics, it is more convenient to define a quantum field theory by its
Lagrangian. Here we describe a simple field theory with quartic
self-interaction

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \mathcal\{L\} = \frac\{1\}\{2\} (\partial_\{\mu\} \phi) (\partial^\{\mu\} \phi) - \frac\{1\}\{2\} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\} \phi^4 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\mathcal\{L\}$ is another operator-valued distribution. As a
mathematical note, the Hilbert space $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$ we defined above
isn't right. You can pretend we still live in this space, but it's an
open mathematical problem to find the \"correct\" space.

We define the time evolution operator $U(t_2, t_1)$ to be the operator
such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
 | \psi(t_2) \rangle = U(t_2, t_1) |\psi(t_1) \rangle 
\end\{aligned\}$$ This time evolution operator can be expanded in terms of
the Dyson series $$\begin\{aligned\}
U(t_2, t_1) &= T\left [ \exp \left ( -i \int_\{t_1\}^\{t_2\} dt H_I(t) \right ) \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $T$ is the time ordering operator and $H_I$ is the interaction
Hamiltonian. Parameters are given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\} = \{m, \lambda, |\psi(0)\rangle \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m$, $\lambda$ are the \"bare mass\" and \"bare
coupling constant\" and $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial condition of
the wave function.

The domain of Applicability $\mathcal\{C\}$ is set by constraints Mass
$m_r < M$ where $m_r$ is the physically measureable mass and $M$ is some
ceiling parameter. Hyperparameters $\mathcal\{HP\}$ are $M$, the mass
limit, and noise parameter $\epsilon$

## Mathematical Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce a few additional pieces of mathematical
infrastructure that we will find useful in subsequent chapters.

### Scattering Matrix

Physical observables in quantum field theory are generally written in
terms of the scattering matrix $S$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
 S = \lim_\{t_2 \to \infty\} \lim_\{t_1 \to -\infty\} U(t_2, t_1) 
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is called a \"matrix\", since the intuition is that
term $\langle \psi_i | S | \psi_j \rangle$ captures the probability of
\"basis state\" $\psi_j$ transitioning to $\psi_i$ over infinite time.
If the input and output states are well chosen, this term can be
estimated from experiment with some noise $\textrm\{Normal\}(0, \epsilon)$

### Second Quantization

Let's define the number operator $N$
$$N = \sum_i \hat\{a\}_i^\{\dagger\} \hat\{a\}_i$$ The number operator counts
the number of particles in a system. Here $\hat\{a\}_i^\dagger$ is the
creation operator and $\hat\{a\}_i$ is the annihilation operator.

### Operator Valued Distributions

Quantum fields are typically mathematically modeled as operator valued
distributions. Conceptually, this corresponds to a type of generalized
function that maps each point in space time to a given operator. This
mathematical abstraction is known to be leaky though, since multiplying
two distributions is often an ill-specified operation, making it
difficult to model interacting quantum fields.

## Real Space Feynman Rules

Terms are computed from Feynman diagrams according to the Feynman rules.
We list the Feynman rules for QED

-   Integration coordinates $x_j$ are represented by vertices

-   Bosonic propagators are represented by wiggly lines connecting two
    vertices.

-   Fermionic propagators are represented by straight lines connecting
    two vertices.

-   A bosonic field $A_\mu(x_i)$ is given by a wiggly line attached to a
    point.

-   A fermionic field $\psi(x_i)$ is given by a straight line attached
    to a point with the arrow towards the point.

-   An anti-fermionic field $\overline\{\psi\}(x_i)$ is given by a
    straight line attached to the point with the arrow pointed away from
    the point.

## Momentum Space Feynman Rules

It is often useful to compute Feynman rules in momentum space rather
than in real space. Analogous transformations of these rules exist for
momentum space.

In this chapter we introduce the structure of the Klein-Gordon field. We
start by deriving the classical Klein-Gordon equation from Schrodinger's
equation along the lines of special relativity, and then discuss
commutation relationships to quantize the field.

## Klein Gordon Equation

We can attempt to modify the energy term in the Schrodinger equation to
more closely match the updated form for energy from special relativity.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac\{m^2c^2\}\{\hbar^2\} \psi = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The d'Alembert operator is denoted by $\Box$ and is defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Box = -\eta^\{\mu \nu\} \partial_\{\mu\} \partial_\{\nu\} = \frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \nabla^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ If we define $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mu &= \frac\{mc\}\{\hbar\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ we can write the Klein-Gordon equation in simplified
form as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (\Box + \mu^2) \psi &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Derivation from Schrodinger's Equation

Recall that the Schrodinger equation for a free particle is given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\hat\{p\}^2\}\{2m\} \psi = \hat\{E\} \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{p\} = -i \hbar \nabla
\end\{aligned\}$$ and $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{E\} = i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall the definition of energy in special relativity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    E = \sqrt\{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's quantize this equation by inserting in the
corresponding operators $$\begin\{aligned\}
    i\hbar\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} \psi = \sqrt\{(-i\hbar \nabla)^2c^2 + m^2c^4\} \psi 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Taking the square root of an operator is quite
challenging, so let's go back and deal with the squared equation.
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4
\end\{aligned\}$$ Quantizing this equation and simplifying, we get
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    (-i\hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\})^2 \psi &= ((-i\hbar \nabla)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4) \psi \\
    -\hbar^2 \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi &= - \hbar^2 \nabla^2 c^2\psi + m^2c^4 \psi \\
    -\frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi &= \frac\{m^2c^2\}\{\hbar^2\} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Solving the Free Klein-Gordon Equation

From the previous section, we have the energy equation from relativity
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 &= p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
\end\{aligned\}$$ To simplify calculations in field theory, it is common
to assume "natural" units where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    c &= \hbar = 1
\end\{aligned\}$$ Under these units we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 &= p^2 + m^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then propose an ansatz for the family of
solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation as follows $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= e^\{i(E t - \vec\{p\}\cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We leave as an exercise to the reader that this proposed
$\psi$ is a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation. To construct the
general solution to the equation, we integrate over all possible values
of $E$ and $\vec\{p\}$ subject to the relativistic constraint that
$E^2 = p^2 + m^2$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int dE \int d\vec\{p\} \psi(t, \vec\{p\}) \delta(E^2 - \vec\{p\}^2 - m^2) e^\{i(E t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ To simplify this expression, we make use of the
relationship $$\begin\{aligned\}
E(\vec\{p\}) &= \pm \sqrt\{\vec\{p\}^2 - m^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us define $$\begin\{aligned\}
\omega &= \sqrt\{\vec\{p\}^2 - m^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then we can replace the integral over $dE$ with just the
sum of these two possible values of $E$ for a given $\vec\{p\}$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int d\vec\{p\} \frac\{\psi(t, \vec\{p\})\}\{2 \omega(\vec\{p\})\} (e^\{i(\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\} + e^\{i(-\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Commutation Relations and Quantization

For a discrete quantum system of $n$ particles, we know that particles
satisfy the following commutation relationship $$\begin\{aligned\}
    [q_i, p_j] &= i \delta_\{ij\} \\
    [q_i, q_j] &= [p_i, p_j] = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ For quantum field theories we instead have continuous
particle densities $\phi(x)$ and momentum densities $\pi(x)$. Recall
that $\phi(x),\pi(x)$ are both operators. We then transform the above
discrete relationships into the following continuous relationships
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [\phi(x), \pi(y)] &= i \delta^\{(3)\}(x-y) \\
    [\phi(x), \phi(y)] &= [\pi(x), \pi(y)] = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Recall then that the classical Klein-Gordon field is
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int \frac\{d^3p\}\{(2\pi)^3\} e^\{i p \cdot x\} \phi(p, t)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\phi(p, t)$ is the Fourier transform into momentum space of the
classical field.

## Defining the Free Field

Crudely, to obtain the free field solution, we replace the spatial wave
function by the spatial density and the momentum wave function by the
momentum density. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &\mapsto \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) \\
    \psi(t, \vec\{p\}) &\mapsto \pi(t, \vec\{p\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then plug into the earlier solution we derived to
obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int d\vec\{p\} \frac\{\pi(t, \vec\{p\})\}\{2 \omega(\vec\{p\})\} (e^\{i(\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\} + e^\{i(-\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$


# Renormalization versus Renormalization Group \{#chap:renormalization_group\}

Renormalization provides a systematic set of rules to perform
corrections to infinities that arise in quantum field-theoretic
calculations in order to arrive at finite numbers. This process is
typically done in two steps: first, regularization is applied to remove
infinite terms in integrals. Second, parameters of the Lagrangian are
adjusted to match known experimental measurements. These adjustments are
interpreted as corrections due to field interactions.

## Classical Analogs

Before the introduction of Einstein's relativity theory, classical
physics studied the concept of an aether that spread across all of space
and time. Charged particles moving in the aether would, due to
self-induction, appear to have a higher mass than the base particle.
Similar calculations where undertaken in hydrodynamics for the inertia
of particles suspended in a fluid. These calculations also yielded
infinities analogous to those that arise in quantum field theory.

## Regularization Methods

There are a variety of methods for controlling the divergent integrals
that arise in quantum field theoretic calculations. One method is
lattice regularization, in which integrals are replaced with finite sums
over meshes. Another method is to cut off large momenta above some level
$\Lambda$.

## Renormalization Group in Critical Phenomenon

For low and high temperatures, perturbative expansions yield solutions
to the correlation functions for Ising models. However, near the
critical crossover point $\xi$, these methods fail since there is a
singularity. The renormalization group constructs a transformation that
shifts the position of the critical point. You can then solve at $\xi$
in the renormalization representation and recover the original solution.

## Quantum Field Theory Setup

We consider the simple $\phi^4$ quantum field theory. This is a
non-Gaussian theory with action

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= \int \Bigg [ \frac\{1\}\{2\}(\nabla \phi(x))^2 + \frac\{1\}\{2\}m_0^2 \phi^2(x) + \frac\{\lambda_0\}\{4!\}\phi^4(x) \Bigg ] d^4 x \\
    &= S_0 + s_I
\end\{aligned\}$$

The two point correlation function is defined as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    G(x) &= \langle \phi(x)\phi(0) \rangle \\
    &= \frac\{\int[\mathcal\{D\}\phi] \phi(x) \phi(0) e^\{-S\}\}\{\int [\mathcal\{D\}\phi] e^\{-S\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Assuming $\lambda_0$ is $0$ we land back to a Gaussian integral which we
can solve.
