The term polymer is used to describe molecules which consist of a large
number of repeating units connected by covalent chemical bonds. Some
polymers are linear, like beads on a necklace; others are branched.
Statistical mechanics has a prominent role in predicting the properties
of polymers. For example, stretching the polymer chains lowers their
conformational entropy, and so under no external force conditions, the
chain naturally tend to retract to regain entropy. The entropy is also
lowered when polymers become compact, as when proteins fold or when DNA
becomes encapsulated within virus heads. Additionally the changes on the
end-to end length of polymer molecules due stretching, can be used to
interpret the viscosities of polymer solutions, the scattering of light,
and some of the dynamic properties of polymer solutions.

In order to understand the thermodynamic behavior due to polymer
stretching, a proper characterization of the random changes in length
needs to be considered. For this, we will consider the *random flight*
model. This model has the advantage that in the case of long chains, it
can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution, and so simplifying the
analysis of the statistical mechanics.

## Polymers and proteins

Polymer molecules are chains of covalently bonded monomer units
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}).

Proteins are polymers that are composed of specific sequence of amino
acids that are linked by peptide bonds. Nature has exquisite control
over primary structure of proteins (*i.e.* amino acid sequence),
facilitating the manufacture of proteins that fold into precise
structures with specific biological functions. There are 20 natural
amino acids that are used to construct biological proteins. The diverse
chemical functionality of these amino acids provides the flexibility to
create enzymes and structural proteins that engage in a wide range of
biological processes (Fig. [\[fig8\]](#fig8)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig8"\}).

## Physical behavior at different length scales

The chemical structure of a polymer dictates the atomic level physical
behavior. Thermal fluctuations at small length scales result in local
deformations that are randomly distributed about a mean structure with a
finite variance. At larger length scales, the correlation between the
fluctuating chain segments vanishes, and the behavior is that of many
independently fluctuating chain segments.

The Central Limit Theorem states that any sum of many independent
identically distributed random variables will tend to a normal (or
Gaussian) distribution, provided the sum of variables has a finite
variance.

Various models for the small-length-scale physical behavior of a polymer
exist (see Fig.4). Though they differ in their small length scale
behavior, they all tend to a Gaussian distribution at large length
scales. We focus on a discrete random walk (or a freely jointed chain)
to demonstrate the crossover to a Gaussian distribution.

The Ideal random-walk (or freely jointed) polymer chain is the simplest
idealization of a flexible polymer. The polymer does not interact with
itself; we can think of it as a phantom chain. This framework is
mathematically useful since random walks appear in a range of seemingly
different physical processes (diffusion, heat transfer, quantum
mechanics, etc).

## Entropic elasticity

Consider a walk on a one-dimensional lattice. After $N$ steps, how far
do you travel on average?

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
X = s_1+s_2+...+s_N=\sum_\{i=1\}^Ns_i
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $s_i = \pm 1$ is the jump vector. The mean-square end displacement
is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
\langle X^2\rangle = \sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\langle s_is_j\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since jumps are uncorrelated, we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq3\}
\langle s_i s_j \rangle = \delta_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

hwere $\delta_\{ij\}$ if $i=j$ and $\delta_\{ij\}=0$ if $i\ne j$. Therefore
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq4\}
\langle X^2\rangle = \sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N \delta_\{ij\} = \sum_\{i=1\}^N 1 =N
\end\{aligned\}$$ This gives the size of a 1-dimensional polymer with
discrete subunits of unit length.

This is extended to 3 dimensions. Consider a chain of $N$ bond vectors
$\vec\{b\}_i$ ($i =1,2,...,N$) with length
$b (\vec\{b\}_i \cdot\vec\{b\}_i =b^2)$, with end-to-end vector
$\vec\{R\} = \sum_\{i=1\}^N\vec\{b\}_i$. The mean-square end-to-end distance
is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
\langle \vec\{R\}^2 \rangle = \sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\langle\vec\{b\}_i\vec\{b\}_j\rangle = \sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N b^2\delta_\{ij\}=b^2N
\end\{aligned\}$$

using similar arguments as the 1-dimensional case.

Decomposing the end-to-end vector into its components
$\vec\{R\} = X\hat\{x\}+ Y\hat\{y\}+Z\hat\{z\}$, we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
\langle X^2 \rangle = \langle Y^2 \rangle = \langle Z^2 \rangle = \frac\{b^2N\}\{3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

since no direction is preferred.

The central limit theorem states that the limiting behavior of any
statistical distribution tends to a Gaussian distribution in the limit
of large sample size. In our case, the limit of large $N$ leads to a
chain probability distribution that is Gaussian. With this, we construct
the polymer chain distribution function.

Generally, a Gaussian distribution for a variable $X$ with zero mean
($\langle X \rangle = 0$) and variance $\langle X^2 \rangle$ is written
as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
p_x(X,N)=\frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\pi\langle X^2\rangle\}\}\exp\left( -\frac\{X^2\}\{2\langle X^2 \rangle\} \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This is the limiting behavior of a random walk in one dimension as the
number of steps is very large ($N \gg 1$).

Assuming the probability distribution is decoupled in the 3 directions,
we write the 3-dimensional probability distribution as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
p(\vec\{R\},N) &= p_x(X,N)p_y(Y,N)p_y(Z,N) \notag\\
&=\left(\frac\{2\pi Nb^2\}\{3\}\right)^\{-3/2\}\exp\left( -\frac\{3\vec\{R^2\}\}\{2Nb^2\} \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

giving the probability that a chain of length $N$ that begins at the
origin will end at position $\vec\{R\}$.

The chain probability gives the free energy for constraining the chain
ends at a fixed position; specifically, we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
F(\vec\{R\})-F(\vec\{0\}) = -k_BT\log\left[ \frac\{p(\vec\{R\},N)\}\{p(\vec\{0\},N)\} \right] = \frac\{3k_BT\}\{2Nb^2\}\vec\{R\}^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

Thus, the chain behaves as a Hookean spring, *i.e* a Gaussian chain
exhibits a linear response to tension. Pulling a Gaussian chain along
the $z$-axis a distance $Z$ requires a tension $\tau$ given by:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
\tau = \frac\{\partial F(Z)\}\{\partial Z\} = \frac\{3k_BT\}\{Nb^2\}Z
\end\{aligned\}$$

This linear response governs the small-scale deformation of a polymer
chain. The response is purely entropic, indicated by the linear scaling
in temperature. This leads to the curious behavior for a stretch elastic
band retracts when heated. The Gaussian chain model does not capture the
behavior once the chain is nearly extended. Full extension reflects the
microscopic details of the model; for example, the nearly inextensible
covalent bonds of the polymer chain. However, many polymer properties
are captured by the Gaussian chain model. This is highly advantageous
because the properties tend to be governed by just a few parameters
(Fig. [\[fig12\]](#fig12)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig12"\}).

## Freely Jointed Model

Consider one link of a polymer chain shown in the
Fig. [\[fjm\]](#fjm)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fjm"\} which has a
fixed length of $b$. The bond angle is given as $\theta$ and the torsion
angle is give as $\phi$, both being free to to rotate. A force of
magnitude $f$ is applied at its ends. Here, we will develop a model for
its streching.

Since each polymer link has a fixed length $b$, the system has only 2
degrees of freedom. When this single link is pulled with a force,
$\vec\{f\} = f \hat\{z\}$, the energy associated with it is given by
$\varepsilon = -\vec\{r\}.\vec\{f\}$. The partition function $q(f)$ would
be:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
q &= \sum \exp(-\beta E) \\
&= \int_0^\{2\pi\}\int_0^\pi\exp[-\beta(-\vec\{r\}\cdot \vec\{f\})]\sin\theta d\theta d\phi\\
&=\int_0^\{2\pi\}\int_0^\pi\exp(\beta zf)\sin\theta d\theta d\phi\\
&=\frac\{2\pi\}\{b\}\int_\{-b\}^\{+b\}\exp(\beta zf) dz\\
&=\frac\{4\pi\}\{bf\}k_BT\sinh\left(\frac\{fb\}\{k_BT\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Consider now a polymer made of $N$ such links. Since the links are
distinguishable, we can write down the partition function $Q(f,N)$ as
$$Q = q^N$$

Using the above partition function, we can evaluate the Helmholtz free
energy, $F(f,N)$ as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
F = -k_BT\log Q 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Helmholtz free energy can be used to calculate the average
displacement $\langle r \rangle$.

Since
$F = -\langle r\rangle f \rightarrow \langle r \rangle = \frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial f\}$,
we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle r\rangle  &= k_BT\frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial f\} = \frac\{k_BT\}\{q^N\}Nq^\{N-1\}\frac\{\partial q\}\{\partial f\} \\
&= \frac\{k_BTN\}\{q\}\left[ \frac\{4\pi\}\{f\} \cosh\left( \frac\{fb\}\{k_BT\} \right) - \frac\{4\pi\}\{bf^2\} \sinh\left( \frac\{fb\}\{k_BT\} \right) \right] \\
&= \frac\{N\}\{f\}\left[ bf\coth\left( \frac\{fb\}\{k_BT\} \right) - k_BT \right]
\end\{aligned\}$$
