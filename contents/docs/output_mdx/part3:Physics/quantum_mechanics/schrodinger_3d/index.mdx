In this chapter, we study techniques for solving Schrodinger's equation
in three dimensions. We can write the equation as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
-\frac\{\hbar^2\}\{2m\}\left [ \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x^2\} + \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial y^2\} + \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial z^2\}\right ] \psi(x, y, z) + V(x, y, z) \psi(x, y,z) &= E \psi(x, y, z) \\
-\frac\{\hbar^2\}\{2m\} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi &= E \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Moving to Spherical Coordinates

The three dimensional Schrodinger's equation becomes easier to solve in
spherical coordinates. A technical challenge to performing this
operation is that we need to represent the Laplacian operator $\nabla^2$
in spherical coordinates. Let us introduce the change of variables

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    u &= u(x, y, z) \\
    v &= v(x, y, z) \\
    w &= w(x, y, z)
\end\{aligned\}$$ In reverse we can write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    x &= x(u, v, w) \\
    y &= y(u, v, w) \\
    z &= z(u, v, w)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let $$\begin\{aligned\}
    r = (x, y, z)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    dr &= (dx, dy, dz)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can also write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    dr &= \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial u\} du + \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial v\} dv + \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial w\} dw
\end\{aligned\}$$

We write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    h_u &= \left | \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial u\} \right | \\
    h_v &= \left | \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial v\} \right | \\
    h_w &= \left | \frac\{\partial r\}\{\partial w\} \right | 
\end\{aligned\}$$

These terms are typically referred to as scale factors. The gradient
term in the $(u, v, w)$ coordinate system is then given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla &= \left ( \frac\{1\}\{h_u\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial u\}, \frac\{1\}\{h_v\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial v\}, \frac\{1\}\{h_w\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial w\} \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ For the specific case of spherical coordinates, we have
a coordinate system $(r, \theta, \phi)$ defined by the relationship
$$\begin\{aligned\}
x &= r \cos \theta \sin \phi
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then compute that the gradient operator is given
by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla &= \left ( \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\}, \frac\{1\}\{r \sin \phi\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial \theta\}, \frac\{1\}\{r\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial \phi\} \right) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Computing the divergence operator in curvilinear coordinates is more
difficult. The general formula which we do not prove is given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla \cdot f &= \left ( h_u h_v h_w \right ) \left ( \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial u\} \left ( h_v h_w  x \right) + \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial v\} \left ( h_u h_w  y \right) + \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial w\} \left ( h_u h_v  z \right) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

Combining this formula with the previous formula allows for the
derivation of the spherical Laplacian equation we use in the next
section.

## Solving the Equation

For simplicity, we assume that the system we are modeling is time
independent. In this case, Schrodinger's equation takes the form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
-\frac\{\hbar^2\}\{2m\} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi = E \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

We use the spherical form of the Laplacian

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \nabla^2 = \frac\{1\}\{r^2\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\} \left ( r^2 \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\} \right) + \frac\{1\}\{r^2 \sin \theta\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial \theta\} \left ( \sin \theta \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial \theta\} \right ) + \frac\{1\}\{r^2 \sin^2 \theta\} \left ( \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial \phi^2\}\right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

Plugging this into Schrodinger's equation, we obtain

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    -\frac\{\hbar^2\}\{2m\} \left [ \frac\{1\}\{r^2\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\} \left ( r^2 \frac\{\partial \psi\}\{\partial r\} \right) + \frac\{1\}\{r^2 \sin \theta\} \frac\{\partial \}\{\partial \theta\} \left ( \sin \theta \frac\{\partial \psi\}\{\partial \theta\} \right ) + \frac\{1\}\{r^2 \sin^2 \theta\} \left ( \frac\{\partial^2 \psi\}\{\partial \phi^2\}\right ) \right ] + V \psi = E\psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

$\psi$ is now a function of the three variables $(r, \theta, \psi)$ and
Schrodinger's equation becomes a partial differential equation in these
three variables. To solve this equation we look to separation of
variables. In particular, we hypothesize the following form for
solutions

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(r, \theta, \phi) &= R(r)Y(\theta, \phi)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $R(r)$ is the radial component of the solution and $Y(\theta,\phi)$
is the angular component. Using this ansatz, Schrodinger's equation
reduces to solving two separate ordinary differential equations.
