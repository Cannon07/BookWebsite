Renormalization provides systematic tools for handling the infinities
that arise in Feynman integrals. The renormalization group provides a
structured method for looking at a physical system at multiple length
scales and serves as a structural explanation of the techniques that
arise in renormalization. The mathematical tools of the renormalization
group come up in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory in
particular.

## Renormalization

There exist a number of methods to systematically cancel the infinities
by the introduction of counterterms. Such counterterms are closely tied
to the regularization methods that we learned about in the previous
chapter, with counterterms typically dependent on the cutoff parameter
$\Lambda$. In this section, we briefly survey such infinities.

### On-shell Scheme

In the on-shell renormalization scheme, parameters in the Lagrangian are
replaced with "physical" parameters that are set by reference to
experimental data.

### Minimal Subtraction Scheme

The minimal subtraction scheme follows a similar procedure, but only
absorbs divergent terms into the counterterms.

## Basic Formulation of Renormalization Group

Suppose that we have state variables $\{s_i\}$ and coupling constants
$\{J_k\}$. Let us suppose the system state is then defined by a
Hamiltonian $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H(\{s_i\}, \{J_k\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ Suppose then that we have a transformation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{s_i\} \mapsto \{\tilde\{s_i\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |\{s_i\}| > |\{\tilde\{s\}_i\}|
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, the transformation shrinks the number of state
variables. If we have a function $\beta$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \beta(\{Z_k\}) = \{\tilde\{Z\}_k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H(\{s_i\}, \{Z_k\}) = H(\{\tilde\{s\}_i\}, \{\tilde\{Z\}_k\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ then we say that the system is renormalizable.
