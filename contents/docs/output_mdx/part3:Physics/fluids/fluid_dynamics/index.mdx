In this chapter, we introduce additional machinery needed to understand
fluid dynamics, the sub-discipline of fluid mechanics that deals with
fluids (gases and liquids) in motion.

### Fluid Dynamics Modeling

Fluid dynamics offers a way to solve practical problems by providing a
systematic understanding of empirical and semi-empirical laws derived
from flow measurement. Empirical and semi-empirical laws are constituted
based on assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a
physical system, which can be expressed mathematically. Every fluid is
assumed to obey conservation of mass, momentum, energy and satisfies the
continuum assumption.

The assumption that mass is conserved simply means that for any fixed
control volume within the fluid, the rate of change of the mass
contained within the control volume (CV) is equal to the difference
between the rate of change of the mass entering the control volume,
$m_\{\mathrm\{in\}\}$, and the rate of change of the mass leaving the
control volume, $m_\{\mathrm\{out\}\}$, if no fluid is generated or consumed
inside the control volume. A mathematical expression for the same would
be:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{CV\}\}\}\{dt\}=\frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{in\}\}\}\{dt\}-\frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{out\}\}\}\{dt\}+\mathrm\{production\ rate\}- \mathrm\{consumption\ rate\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ In a similar way, governing equations can be set up for
the conservation of energy and momentum.

The continuum assumption is an extension of continuum mechanics under
which fluids can be treated as continuous despite the fact that they are
composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic
properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and velocity are
taken to be well-defined at infinitesimal volume elements and computed
as average values of the molecular properties.

Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications such as fluid flow
modeling for aircraft and spacecraft design, determining the mass flow
rate of chemicals in industries, vascular stenting approaches to improve
blood flow, etc.

### Navier Stokes Equations

Fluid flow is typically modeled using the Navier--Stokes equations
(named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes), which are
differential equations that describe the force balance at a given point
within a fluid through changes in momentum (force) in response to
pressure $P$ and viscosity, parameterized by the kinematic viscosity
$\nu$. For an incompressible fluid with vector velocity field **u**, the
Navier--Stokes equations are $$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \{\frac \{\partial u \}\{\partial t\}\}+(u \cdot \nabla )u =-\{\frac \{1\}\{\rho \}\}\nabla P+\nu \nabla ^\{2\}u \}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations are obtained using calculus.
Practically, only the simplest cases of fluid flow, which generally
involve non-turbulent, steady flow (quantified by a low Reynolds
number), can be solved exactly. For more complex cases, especially those
involving turbulence, solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations can
currently only be computed through simulations, which constitutes the
field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Since the Reynolds number
is an important quantify in fluid dynamics, the following subsection
provides a brief description:

## Fluid Flow between Parallel Plates

plates.](figures/Physics/fluids/fluid_dynamics/Poiseuille flow.png)\{#fig:plateFlow
width="\\linewidth"\}

In this section, we solve a first simple fluid flow problem of flow
between two parallel plates. Flow occurs along the $x$ direction, the
$y$ direction is perpendicular to the plates, and $z$ is out of plane.
We recognize that independent of time, $$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_y &= 0 \\
    v_z &=0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Since there is no velocity in the $y$ and $z$ directions
we know that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial y\} =\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial z\} &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The continuity equation implies that
$\frac\{\partial v_x\}\{\partial x\}=0$, therefore $v_x=v_x(y)$.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    -\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} + \mu \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &= 0\\
    \frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} &= \mu \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, since $v_x$ is not a function of $x$, we have that
$\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}$ must equal a constant. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} &= C_1 \\
    P &= C_1 x + C_2
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's now apply the boundary conditions. At $x=0$, $P=P_1$, hence
$C_2=P_1$. At $x=L$, $P=P_2$, hence $C_1=-\Delta P/L$, where
$\Delta P=P_1-P_2$. From the Navier-Stokes equation, we now have
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mu\frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &= C_1=-\Delta P/L \\
    \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &=-\frac\{\Delta P\}\{\mu L\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$v_x$ can be written down as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_x &=-\frac\{\Delta P\}\{2 \mu L\}y^2+C_3 y+C_4 \\ 
    \frac\{\partial v_x\}\{\partial y\} &=  \frac\{\Delta P\}\{\mu L\} y +C_3
\end\{aligned\}$$

No slip conditions means that $C_3=0$ and
$C_4=\frac\{\Delta P d^2\}\{8 \mu L\}$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_x &= \frac\{\Delta P\}\{2 \mu L\}\left (\frac\{d^2\}\{4\}-y^2 \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Flow through a pipe

Consider steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in an
infinitely long round pipe of diameter $D$ or radius $R=D/2$. Let's
ignore the effects of gravity. A constant pressure gradient
$\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}$ is applied in the $x$ direction,

The applied pressure gradient is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}=\frac\{P_2-P_1\}\{x_2-x_2\}= \textrm\{constant\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two arbitrary locations along the $x$ axis,
and $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the pressures at those two locations. Note that
we adopt a modified cylindrical coordinate system with $x$ instead of
$z$ for the axial component, names, $(r,\theta, x)$ and
$(u_r, u_\{\theta\},u)$. Let's derive an expression for the velocity field
inside the pipe.

We make a few assumptions that are valid in this case. First we assume
that the pipe is infinitely long in the $x$ direction. We also assume
that the flow is steady (all partial derivatives are zero) and that the
flow is parallel (no $r$ component of velocity, $u_r=0$).

We also assume the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian and with
constant properties, and the flow is laminar and that a
constant-pressure gradient is applied in the $x$ direction such that
pressure changes linearly with respect to $x$. We also assume the
velocity field is axisymmetric with no swirl, implying that
$u_\{\theta\}=0$ and all partial derivatives with respect to $\theta$ are
zero. Finally, we ignore the effects of gravity.

The following are the boundary conditions for this problem: First, a no
slip condition at the wall $$\begin\{aligned\}
\textrm\{At \}r=R, \quad \vec\{V\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Second, the centerline of the pipe is an axis of symmetry
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\textrm\{At \}r=o, \quad \frac\{du\}\{dr\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's write down the differential equations from the Navier-Stokes
relations. Incompressible continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates
can be written as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{\partial(r u_r)\}\{\partial r\}+\frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{u_\{\theta\}\}\{\partial \theta\}+\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}=0 \implies \frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$ since the first two terms are zero given the
corresponding assumptions. This equation implies that $u$ is not a
function of $x$. Furthermore, from our assumptions, $u$ is neither a
function of time or $\theta$, therefore, we conclude that $u$ is at most
a function of $r$: $u=u(r)$.

Let's write down the axial momentum equation and apply cancellations
from our assumptions.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho \bigg( \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial t\}\} +\cancelto\{\}\{u\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial r\}\}+\cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{u_\{\theta\}\}\{r\}\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial \theta\}\}+\cancelto\{\}\{u\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}\}\bigg)=-\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}+\cancelto\{\}\{\rho g\} + \mu\bigg( \frac\{1\}\{r\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\} (r\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial r\}) + \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{1\}\{r^2\} \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial \theta^2\}\}+ \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial x^2\}\}\bigg)    
\end\{aligned\}$$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
\implies \frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{d\}\{dr\}\bigg(r\frac\{du\}\{dr\}\bigg)=\frac\{1\}\{\mu\}\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}    
\label\{eq:pipe\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since $P$ is only a function of $x$ from the $r$-momentum equations in a
very similar manner to the axial momentum equation, the partial
derivative term can be replaced by a total derivative operator in eqn.
[\[eq:pipe\]](#eq:pipe)\{reference-type="ref" reference="eq:pipe"\}:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    r\frac\{du\}\{dr\}=\frac\{r^2\}\{2\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_1
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Note that the
pressure gradient is a constant here. Integrating again, we get

$$\begin\{aligned\}
u=\frac\{r^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_1 \mathrm\{ln\}\ r+C_2
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $C_2$ is another constant of integration.

Applying boundary condition 2, we get $C_1=0$. Applying boundary
condition 2, $$\begin\{aligned\}
    u=\frac\{R^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_2=0 \implies C_2=-\frac\{R^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the axial velocity can be written down as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    u=\frac\{1\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}(r^2-R^2)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The velocity profile is thus in the shape of a paraboloid.
