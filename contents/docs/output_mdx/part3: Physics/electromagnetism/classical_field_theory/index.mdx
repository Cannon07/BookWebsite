The physical theories we've considered so far all have had finite sets
of parameters. But for many more complex physical systems, we find that
we're interested in modeling systems with an infinite number of
parameters.

We define a scalar field $\varphi$ is a function
$\mathbb\{R\}^4 \to \mathbb\{R\}$ where we use $\mathbb\{R\}^4$ to denote
spacetime.

In
[\[chap:maxwells_equations\]](#chap:maxwells_equations)\{reference-type="ref+label"
reference="chap:maxwells_equations"\} we saw our first example of a field
theory in this book. We will cover a number more field theories in
future chapters.
