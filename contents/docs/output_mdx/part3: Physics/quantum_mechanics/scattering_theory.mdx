A scattering process studies the collision of particles. Mathematically
for a scattering process, we start from an input state of particles and
end with a final state. The scattering process can be modeled either
classically or quantum mechanically.

## Classical Scattering

Broadly, classical scattering can be broken into elastic and ineleastic
scattering. Elastic scattering conserves energy and treats particles as
point objects that don't change in the collision. Inelastic collisions
allow for the possibility of deformation and the loss of energy during
the collision process.

## Quantum Mechanical Scattering

The transformation process can be modeled as a time dependent
perturbation since the shifting event can often be tightly focused in
time (a particle collision for example)

Let us start by writing the Hamiltonian to model the scattering process
as as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= H_0 + V_I(r) \\
    H_0 &= \frac\{p^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The eigenvalues of the kinetic energy component $H_0$
are $$\begin\{aligned\}
E_k &= \frac\{\hbar^2k^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let $\alpha(t)$ denote the state at time $t$. We have the transition
equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    |\alpha(t)\rangle_I &= U_I(t)|\alpha(t_0) \rangle_I\\
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $U_I$ satisfies the equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    i\hbar\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} U_I(t, t_0) &= V_I(t) U_I(t, t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U_I(t_0) &= I \\
    V_I(t) &= \exp(iH_0t/\hbar)V\exp(-iH_0t/\hbar)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This equation has solution $$\begin\{aligned\}
U_I(t) &= 1 - \frac\{i\}\{\hbar\}\int_\{t_0\}^T V_I(t')U_I(t', t_0)dt'
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that this equation is integrating operators. We can
then derive the following general solution for the transmission
probability from basis state $i$ to basis state $n$

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle n | U_I(t)| i \rangle = \delta_\{ni\} - \frac\{i\}\{\hbar\}\sum_m \langle n|V|m \rangle \int_\{t_0\}^t e^\{i\omega_\{nm\}t'\} \langle m | U_I(t')|i \rangle dt'
\end\{aligned\}$$

For specific scattering potentials, we can then derive specific
scattering amplitudes. Such scattering amplitudes arise often in high
energy physics applications.
