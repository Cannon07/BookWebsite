We will at various times have to make use of various transforms that
turn one type of equation into another. These transforms will prove
especially useful to us as we encounter complex sets of differential
equations. Having a toolbox of transforms we can throw at systems will
enable us to solve much more sophisticated systems than we could do
otherwise.

## Fourier Transforms

The Fourier transform is a mathematical operation of fundamental
importance to modern physics and engineering. Let $f$ be an integrable
function $f: \mathbb\{R\} \to \mathbb\{C\}$.

$$\hat\{f\}(k) = \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} f(x) e^\{i x k\} dx$$

We will also use the notation

$$\mathcal\{F\}(f) = \hat\{f\}$$

to denote the Fourier transform as an operator $\mathcal\{F\}$. If you're
not familiar with the Fourier transform, this definition may feel quite
opaque. Why does it make sense? Let's start by first outlining a few
basic properties of the Fourier transform

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{F\}(a f(x) + b g(x)) &= \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} (a f(x) + b g(x))e^\{-2\pi i x k\} dx \\
    &= \frac\{a\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} f(x) e^\{i x k\} dx + \frac\{b\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} g(x) e^\{i x k\} dx \\
    &= a \mathcal\{F\}(f(x)) + b \mathcal\{F\}(g(x))
\end\{aligned\}$$

Put another way, $\mathcal\{F\}$ is a linear operator. Fourier transforms
have a number of really powerful other properties. Let's consider
another such property. Let $f$ be a function and $f'$ its derivative.
Then

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{F\}(f')(k) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} f'(x)e^\{ixk\} dx
\end\{aligned\}$$

To compute this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let
$u = e^\{ixk\}$ and $dv = f'(x)dx$. Then $du = ik e^\{ixk\}$ and $v = f(x)$.
Then we can write

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{F\}(f')(k) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\}\int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} u dv \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \left (uv \Big |^\{\infty\}_\{-\infty\} - \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} v du \right ) \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{2\pi\} \left (e^\{ixk\} f(x) \Big |^\{\infty\}_\{-\infty\} - \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} f(x) ike^\{ixk\} dx \right ) \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

We assume that $f(x)$ goes to 0 at both infinities, so we are left with

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{F\}(f')(k) &= \frac\{-ik\}\{2\pi\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} f(x) e^\{ixk\} dx \\
&= -ik \mathcal\{F\}(f)(k)
\end\{aligned\}$$

That is, the Fourier transform converts a derivative into multiplication
by a scalar constant.

## Convexity and Legendre Transform

The Legendre transform is a type of functional transformation that
arises in a number of different places in physics. In this section we'll
give a brief introduction to the Legendre transform. We'll start by
defining a *convex* sets and functions.

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb\{R^n\}$. We say that $U$ is convex if for all
$\vec\{v\}, \vec\{u\} \in U$, and for all $t \in [0, 1]$, we have that
$t\vec\{v\} + (1-t)\vec\{u\} \in U$.

A function $f: U \to \mathbb\{R\}$, where $U \subseteq \mathbb\{R\}^n$ is
said to be convex if for all $\vec\{v\}, \vec\{u\} \in U$, and for all
$t \in [0, 1]$, we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
f(t\vec\{v\} + (1-t)\vec\{u\}) \leq tf(\vec\{v\}) + (1-t)f(\vec\{u\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Convex functions arise often in optimization and in physics.
Intuitively, a convex function is \"well-behaved\". The Legendre
transform is defined for convex functions as follows.

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb\{R\}^n$ be a convex set. Let
$f: U \to \mathbb\{R\}$ be a convex function. We defined the Legendre
transform of $f$ to be a function $f^*$ defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
f^*(y) = \mathrm\{sup\}_\{\vec\{x\} \in U\} \left (\vec\{y\}^T\vec\{x\} - f(x) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\vec\{y\} \in V \subseteq \mathbb\{R\}^n$ is a set
defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
V = \{\vec\{y\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^n : f^*(y) < \infty \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $f^*$ is referred to as the convex conjugate of
$f$.

The mathematical method of performing this change of variables is called
a Legendre Transform. The method is defined according to the following
steps:

A function $y=f(x)$ is defined as a list of $x$, $y$, pairs, *i.e.* the
plot of $y(x)$ graphs $$\begin\{aligned\}
(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3), \dotsc 
\end\{aligned\}$$ and so on. Equivalently, it is possible to express the
same function in terms of the tangent slope $c(x)$ and the corresponding
$y$-intercepts, *i.e.* the points $$\begin\{aligned\}
(c_1,b_1), (c_2,b_2), (c_3,b_3),\dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$ For a change $dx$ in the $x$-variable, the change $dy$
is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
dy = \left(\frac\{dy\}\{dx\}\right)dx = c(x)dx \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ From this point on the curve, we can extend a line back
to $x = 0$ to find the $y$-intercept $b(x)$, such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
y(x) = c(x)x+b(x) \rightarrow b(x) = y(x)-c(x)x \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ The resulting function for the series of intercepts
versus the slopes (*i.e.* $b = b(c)$) contains the same information as
$y = y(x)$.

A change in $b(c)$ is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
db &= dy - cdx - xdc = -xdc
\end\{aligned\}$$

As an example, consider the function $y = (x - 2)^2$. We use a Legendre
Transform to shift the variable from $x$ to the slope $c$
(Fig.[\[fig:Fig5\]](#fig:Fig5)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig5"\}).

The slope of the function is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
c = 2(x-2) \rightarrow x =\frac\{c\}\{2\} + 2
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Legendre transform gives us a new function $b(c)$, given by:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
b=y-cx=\frac\{c^2\}\{4\} - \frac\{c^2\}\{2\}-2c=-\frac\{c^2\}\{4\}-2c 
\end\{aligned\}$$

We note that this Legendre transform correctly relates back to the
original function by noting that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{db\}\{dc\} = -\frac\{c\}\{2\} -2 = -x \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ endexample

## Laplace Transform

The Laplace transform provides a technique for transforming a
real-valued function into a complex-valued function in a structured way.
Like the Fourier transform, it will enable us to simplify certain
complex mathematical operations.

Let's suppose that we have a function $f: \mathbb\{R\}^+ \to \mathbb\{R\}$.
We then define

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}\{f\}(s) &= \int_0^\{\infty\} f(t) e^\{-s t\} dt 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $s$ is a complex number. That means $L\{f\}$ has
type $\mathbb\{C\} \to \mathbb\{C\}$. Structurally, you might note the
similarities between the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform.
And indeed, the two share similar properties. To start, $\mathcal\{L\}$ is
a linear operator

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}\{af + bg\} &= \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} (a f(t) + b g(t)) e^\{-st\} dt \\
    &= a\int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} f(t)e^\{-st\} dt + b \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} g(t) e^\{-st\} dt \\
    &= a\mathcal\{L\}\{f\} + b \mathcal\{L\}\{g\}
\end\{aligned\}$$
