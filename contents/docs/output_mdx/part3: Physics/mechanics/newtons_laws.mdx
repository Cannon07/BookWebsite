In
[\[chap:simple_physics\]](#chap:simple_physics)\{reference-type="ref+label"
reference="chap:simple_physics"\}, we introduced simple physical theories
for a static particle and a particle with constant velocity. These
theories introduced the formalism of differentiable programs for simple
systems.

In this chapter we introduce Newton's laws. These simple mathematical
relationships allow scientists to model a vast range of physical
phenomena. Translating these laws into differentiable programs will give
us building blocks that we can apply later in the book to more
sophisticated physical systems.

Classical mechanics, also called Newtonian mechanics, is based Newton's
laws of motion which govern the motion of macroscopic objects. It allows
a continuous spectrum of energies and a continuous spatial distribution
of matter. As a sneak peek, Newton's laws of motion are:

## The Three Laws

Let's now formulate these laws precisely. In order to define Newton's
laws, we first have to define force and acceleration. We define
acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{a\} = \frac\{d\vec\{v\}\}\{dt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

What is the type of acceleration? Well, we've so far seen that velocity
$\vec\{v\}$ at time $t$ has type $\mathbb\{R\}^3$. Since we're taking the
time derivative, it follows that $\vec\{a\}$ at time $t$ also has type
$\mathbb\{R\}^3$. If we wanted the type of acceleration over all time, we
would instead use the type $\mathbb\{R\} \to \mathbb\{R\}^3$ (convince
yourself that this makes sense.) The next natural question then is to
ask what causes acceleration? The simple answer is that forces cause
acceleration.

You already know what forces are. Picture yourself pushing something, or
kicking it. Or a little more abstractly, the effect of gravity on a
thrown ball. All of these are forces. There is a fundamental
relationship between the force acting on an object and its current
acceleration. This relation is *Newton's Second Law,* which states that
the force $\vec\{F\}$ on an object is a vector defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{F\} = m \vec\{a\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ []\{#newton2 label="newton2"\}

We know that $m \in \mathbb\{R\}^+$, so it follows that the type of
$\vec\{F\}$ at time $t$ is $\mathbb\{R\}^3$. Expressed in more standard
physics language, force is a vector. Newton's second law describes the
motion of a particle with a force acting upon it. Let's take a look at
what happens when there is no force:

Netwon's First Law states that an object either remains at rest or
continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted on by a force.
Note that Newton's First Law follows from Newton's Second Law in our
framing, since if $\vec\{F\} = 0$, then $\vec\{a\} = 0$, implying that
velocity must remain constant. If an object was at rest ($\vec\{v\} = 0$),
then it would continue to remain at rest and if it was in motion
($\vec\{v\} \neq  0$), then it would continue to move at that same
velocity. For the physicists in the audience, we're ignoring
non-inertial reference frames to simplify our presentation here. We'll
return to the question of different reference frames later in the book.

Newton's first two laws give us powerful tools to understand the motion
of moving particles, but they don't give us any tools yet to understand
the interactions between particles (or larger bodies). Luckily, Newton's
third law does this for us

Newton's Third Law states that when one body exerts a force on a second
body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude
and opposite in direction on the first body.

Newton's Third Law is a little different from the other laws in that
introduces a new principle. To explain what's happening here more
deeply, we'll find it useful to introduce the concept of momentum. We
will say that the momentum of an object is a vector $\vec\{p\}$ defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{p\} = m\vec\{v\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Note that we can restate Newton's second law in terms of momentum: the
force $\vec\{F\}$ on an object is a vector defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{F\} = m \frac\{d \vec\{p\}\}\{dt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ []\{#newton2momentum label="newton2momentum"\}

You will derive this variant in the exercises. With this framework in
place, let's return to Newton's third law. From our reworked Newton's
second law, we know that force $\vec\{F\}$ is a scaled version of the rate
of change of momentum $\vec\{p\}$ for an object. Let's suppose we have two
objects that exert equal and opposite forces on one another. Let's write
this as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{F_1\} = -\vec\{F_2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's now rewrite this equation using Definition
[\[newton2momentum\]](#newton2momentum)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="newton2momentum"\}. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{d\vec\{p_1\}\}\{dt\} = -\frac\{d\vec\{p_2\}\}\{dt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's factor out the derivative and bring both equations
onto the same side $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dt\}(\vec\{p_1\} + \vec\{p_2\}) = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ This equation has a particular intriguing form. It's
stating that the total momentum of the system
$\vec\{p\} = \vec\{p_1\} + \vec\{p_2\}$ doesn't change with respect to time.
You can think of this as an *invariant* of the system. Or put another
way, a symmetry the system must obey.

## A Particle Moving Under Gravity

It's possible to use Newton's three laws to model a wide variety of
physical systems. Before we move into examples, we'll introduce one
additional law, Newton's law of universal gravitation. The basic idea of
Newtonian gravity is that every point mass attracts every other point
mass by a force acting along the line connecting the two points.
Mathematically, we say that the attractive force $\vec\{F\}_\{12\}$ has
magnitude given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|\vec\{F\}_\{12\}\| = G \frac\{m_1 m_2\}\{r^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m_1, m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and
$r$ the distance between the two point masses. $G$ here is a constant
known as the *gravitational constant*.

For objects on earth, it is useful to combine terms to get a simpler
equation. There are two observations that we can make here. First, the
mass of earth $M_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}$ is a fixed quantity. Second, the
radius of earth $r_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}$ is known. So long as an object is
close to the surface of earch, we can approximate
$r \approx r_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}$. Combining these two facts, let's define
the gravitational constant $g$ by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g = G \frac\{M_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}\}\{r_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The gravitational force on Earth's surface can then be
written $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|\vec\{F\}\| = mg
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m$ is the mass of a given object.

We can define a form of potential energy on earth's surface provided by
gravity. In particular, the gravitational potential energy on Earth's
surface is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    V(h) = mgh
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is Earth's
gravitational constant, and $h$ is the height of the object above the
surface of the earth.

## A Particle on Earth's Surface

We've introduced a lot of concepts in the last few pages. Let's tie
these all together and construct a new physical theory for the motion of
a particle on Earth's surface acting under gravity.

As usual, let's start with the state space. As before, we will want to
track the position and velocity of the particle. The difference is that
now we will want to track the acceleration as well. That suggests that
our state space would be the tuple $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{S\} =\mathbb\{R\}^3 \times \mathbb\{R\}^3 \times \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's move now to symmetries. As before, we have conservation of energy
in our model. However, our energy function will be more complex than
previously since we consider the potential energy for gravity that we
have introduced. In particular, we define our energy

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E &= \frac\{1\}\{2\}m\|\vec\{v\}\|^2 + mgh
\end\{aligned\}$$

Those of you with physics experience will note that this means our
particle can't land on the ground since we don't have terms that govern
the interaction of the particle bouncing or dissipating its energy. But
no need to address all these complications yet. Let's keep going. The
next thing we need to address is the creation of a time evolution rule
for the system. The first thing that we need to determine in this case
is the acceleration of the system. Let's apply the simplified form of
Newton's law of gravitation for particles near earth's surface. This
means we can define acceleration by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|\vec\{a\}\| = g
\end\{aligned\}$$

The direction of this vector must point down towards earth by common
sense. Let's follow a convention that the $z$-axis corresponds to height
and the $0$-plane corresponds to the earth. (We're ignoring the
curvature of earth in this model of course.). We can then define more
carefully that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{a\} = - g \hat\{k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ These conventions actually call into our question our
original definition of the state space $\mathcal\{S\}$. We can't deal with
objects at negative heights as we already noted. To be careful, we'd
need to define the position space as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (\mathbb\{R\}^3)^+ := \{\vec\{x\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3 | x_3 \geq 0 \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us now return to the definition of the time
evolution rule. The idea is that we can integrate forward from the
acceleration to the velocity. In particular, the velocity at any given
time $t$ is $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{v\}_t &= \vec\{v\}_0 + \int_\{0\}^t (-g \hat\{k\}) dt \\
&= \vec\{v\}_0 - g t \hat\{k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can reapply this same reasoning to say that the
position at time $t$ is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{x\}_t &= \vec\{x\}_0 + \int_\{0\}^t \vec\{v\}_t dt \\
    &= \vec\{x\}_0 + \int_\{0\}^t \left (\vec\{v_0\} + \int_\{0\}^t (- g \hat\{k\}) dt \right ) dt \\
    &= \vec\{x\}_0 + \int_\{0\}^t \left (\vec\{v_0\} - g t \hat\{k\} \right ) dt \\
    &= \vec\{x\}_0 + t \vec\{v\}_0 - \frac\{1\}\{2\}gt^2 \hat\{k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

There are still a couple more constraints we need to add to this system
to make it realistic. The first is that we need to acknowledge a
limitation of Newtonian mechanics that it doesn't deal with particles
that are moving very fast. Let $c$ be the speed of light, then we would
want to say $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|\vec\{v\}\| \ll c
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, the velocity is much less than the speed of
light. We can also formalize our constraint that particles can't be too
far from earth's surface as follows $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|\vec\{x\}\| \ll r_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note also finally that in our model, we initially let
acceleration be any value in $\mathbb\{R\}^3$. However, it turns out that
acceleration is set by Newton's laws to be a fixed value. This means we
can simplify our state space by removing the acceleration term. Finally,
as before, we will also want to specify that the mass of the object is
neither too large nor too small. We can saw $$\begin\{aligned\}
    M_\{\textrm\{min\}\} \ll m \ll M_\{\textrm\{earth\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The final thing we have to do is put together an
observation model for this system. Let's borrow the same observation
model as we used previously. This yields $$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(\vec\{x\}, \vec\{v\}) = \vec\{x\} + \mathcal\{N\}(0,1)^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ (We're using shorthand for the normal distribution in 3
dimensions above.)

This physical theory is more complex than our previous theory. We've
also introduced a new concept here, that of the \"Domain of
Applicability.\" The reason is that our model uses the approximate form
for gravitation on the surface of earth. This domain of applicability is
controlled by a \"hyperparameter\" $c$. We call $c$ a hyperparameter
since it is a parameter of the model that can't be directly learned from
experimental measurements the way the other parameters are.

Let's now try to write down a differentiable program that models this
physical system in a general form.

    $x_0$, $v_0$, $a_0$: $\mathbb\{R\}^3$
    def state(t: $\mathbb\{R\}^+$) -> $\mathbb\{R\}^3$:
      return $x_0$ + $\int$($v_0$ + $\int$(a(v), 0, u, dv), 0, t, du)

Of course in our case, we know the analytical update rule already, but
this general form will prove later for more complex systems.

## Rigid Body Motion

In this section, we consider a rigid body in space. For simplicity, we
consider an infinitesimally stick of length 1.

The state space of this would be $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{S\} = \mathbb\{R\}^3 \times \textrm\{SO\}(3)
\end\{aligned\}$$ since we have to consider the position of the object
along with possible orientations. The base position of one side is given
by a point in $\mathbb\{R\}^3$ while the three dimensional orientation is
given by a matrix in $SO(3)$ that rotates the unit axis (without loss of
generality the $x$-axis) to the direction of stick.

The motion of the stick is given by the velocity of the center of the
mass and by any potential rotation around the center of mass. We leave
the problem of creating a full physical theory for rigid body motion to
the exercises.
