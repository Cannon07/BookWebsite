In macroscopic systems, particles constantly change between any of the
available energy states predicted by classical or quantum mechanics.
Therefore, *ignorance is a law of nature* for many particle systems, and
this ignorance requires a statistical description of observations and
the admittance of ever-present fluctuations. The presence of such
microscopic fluctuations, however, does not prevent a system from
reaching macroscopic equilibrium. Thus, before we venture into the
subject of characterizing fluctuations, it is necessary to understand
the concept of *equilibrium*, which is the subject of classical
thermodynamics.

In the first part of this chapter we will review the concept of
thermodynamic equilibrium under the view of classical thermodynamics.
Using the first and second law of thermodynamics we will derive the
relations that defines a state of macroscopic equilibrium.

## Heat, Work, and Entropy

We will denote heat by $Q$, work by $W$ and entropy with $S$. As we will
see in the remainder of this part, understanding the relationships
between these quantities will be crucial to deepen our understanding of
thermodynamics.

## First Law of Thermodynamics

:::

The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the conservation of
energy principle, provides the basis for studying the relationships
among the various forms of energy and energy interactions. The law
states that *although energy assumes many forms, the total quantity of
energy is constant, and when energy disappears in one form it appears
simultaneously in other forms*.

The energy of a system is measured by its internal energy $U$, and is
defined as the net sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all the
molecules in a macroscopic material. The internal energy is an extensive
property, meaning that the internal energy depends linearly on the size
of the system (Fig.[\[fig:Fig1\]](#fig:Fig1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig1"\}).

According to the First Law of Thermodynamics any change in the internal
energy occurs due to the addition of heat $Q$ and work $W$, according to
the relation:

$$\label\{First Law\}
dU = \delta Q + \delta W$$

The difference in the notation of the change of internal energy $(dU)$
from the addition of heat $(\delta Q)$ or work $(\delta W)$, lies in the
fact that internal energy is a state variable, while heat and work are
path dependent. However, once heat and work are applied, they are
indistinguishable on a macroscale.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The origins of the second law lies in a statement that it is impossible
for any self-acting process or machine to produce net flow of heat from
a region of low temperature. The law states that an isolated system
always proceeds from an ordered to a more disordered state, or else it
undergoes no change at all.

The level of order from a system is measured by the entropy $S$, and
according to the second law *the entropy of the universe tends to a
maximum* (Rudolf Claussius, 1865). This is stated mathematically as:

$$\label\{Second Law\}
\{\left( dS \right)\}_\{U,V,N\} \ge 0$$

where the subscripts $U$, $V$ and $N$ indicates constant internal
energy, volume and number of particles, respectively.

## Thermodynamics Driving Forces

A thermodynamic system can be defined according to their *extensive*
variables, *i.e.*, variables that vary linearly with the system size.
For example, we define the internal energy $U$ to be a function of
extensive variables $S$, $V$, and $N = (N_1,N_2,...,N_r)$, where $r$ is
the number of chemical species in the system. Therefore, we have
$U = U(S,V,N)$. Differential changes in the extensive variables leads to
a differential change in the internal energy, such that:
$$\label\{Internal Energy Change\}
dU =\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial S\}\right) \}_\{V,N_1,...,N_r\} \hspace\{-1cm\} dS 
\hspace\{0.6cm\} + 
\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial V\}\right) \}_\{S,N_1,...,N_r\} \hspace\{-1cm\} dV
\hspace\{0.6cm\} + 
\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial N_i\}\right) \}_\{S,V,N_\{j\neq i\}\} \hspace\{-1cm\} dN_i$$

The partial derivatives are *intensive* variables, *i.e.* variables that
do not depended on the size of the system. We define these as:

$$\label\{intensive variables\}
\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial S\}\right) \}_\{V,N_1,...,N_r\} \hspace\{-1cm\} \equiv T \hspace\{0.5cm\} 
\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial V\}\right) \}_\{S,N_1,...,N_r\} \hspace\{-1cm\} \equiv -p\ 
\hspace\{0.5cm\} 
\{ \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial N_i\}\right) \}_\{S,V,N_\{j\neq i\}\} \hspace\{-1cm\} \equiv \mu_i$$

Where $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure, and $\mu_i$ is chemical
potential of species $i$. The change in internal energy can then be
written as:

$$\label\{Eq5\}
dU = TdS - pdV + \sum_\{i=1\}^\{r\} \mu_idN_i$$

Since $U$ is a state variable, we can choose any path to find a
differential change. Equation ([\[Eq5\]](#Eq5)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq5"\}) states that any change in the internal energy of the
system, is the result of a quasi-static heat flux ($TdS$), mechanical
work ($- pdV$) and chemical work ($\mu_idN_i$) to the system.

Equivalently, we can define the system according to its entropy
$S=S(U,V,N)$, resulting in a differential change:

$$\label\{Internal Energy\}
dS = \frac\{1\}\{T\}dU + \frac\{p\}\{T\}dV - \sum_\{i=1\}^r\frac\{\mu_i\}\{T\}dN_i$$

This formulation is useful to discuss the second law of thermodynamics.

:::

Consider a closed, isolated system which cannot exchange heat, work, or
particles with its surroundings
(Fig.Â [\[fig:Fig2\]](#fig:Fig2)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig2"\}). We initially prepare the system such that part
of the system (subsystem 1) has parameter values $U^\{(1)\}$, $V^\{(1)\}$,
and $N^\{(1)\}$. We similarly define $U^\{(2)\}$, $V^\{(2)\}$, and $N^\{(2)\}$
for the rest of the system (subsystem 2). Making the statement that the
entropy is additive, *i.e.* $S^\{(1)\} + S^\{(2)\} = S$), we can write:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Entropy Change1\}
dS = \frac\{1\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}dU^\{(1)\} + \frac\{p^\{(1)\}\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}dV^\{(1)\} - \sum_\{i=1\}^r\frac\{\mu_i^\{(1)\}\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}dN_i^\{(1)\} + \notag\\ \frac\{1\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}dU^\{(2)\}+ \frac\{p^\{(2)\}\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}dV^\{(2)\} - \sum_\{i=1\}^r\frac\{\mu_i^\{(2)\}\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}dN_i^\{(2)\}  \hspace\{0.3cm\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since the total system is closed and isolated, we can write
$dU^\{(2)\}=-dU^\{(1)\}$, $dV^\{(2)\}=-dV^\{(1)\}$, and
$\{dN\}_i^\{(2)\}=-\{dN\}_i^\{(1)\}$.

Therefore, we can write:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Entropy Change2\}
dS = \left(\frac\{1\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}-\frac\{1\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}\right)dU^\{(1)\} + \left(\frac\{p^\{(1)\}\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}-\frac\{p^\{(2)\}\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}\right)dV^\{(1)\} \notag\\ - \sum_\{i=1\}^r\left(\frac\{\mu_i^\{(1)\}\}\{T^\{(1)\}\}-\frac\{\mu_i^\{(2)\}\}\{T^\{(2)\}\}\right)dN_i^\{(1)\} \hspace\{2.8cm\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

According to the second law of thermodynamics, any spontaneous process
requires $dS \geq 0$. At equilibrium, the entropy will achieve its
maximum and hence satisfy the condition $dS=0$ for arbitrary small
changes $dU^\{(1)\}$, $dV^\{(1)\}$, and $dN^\{(1)\}$:

-   Thermal equilibrium occurs when $T^\{(1)\}=T^\{(2)\}$

-   Mechanical equilibrium occurs when $p^\{(1)\}=p^\{(2)\}$

-   Chemical equilibrium (no reactions) occurs when
    $\mu_i^\{(1)\}=\mu_i^\{(2)\}$

Notice that although thermal and mechanical equilibrium implies spatial
homogeneity of $T$ and $p$, the condition of spatial homogeneity $\mu_i$
should not be interpreted as homogeneous concentration or density of
species $i$.

In the case $T^\{(1)\}=T^\{(2)\}$, $p^\{(1)\}=p^\{(2)\}$:

-   If $\mu_i^\{(1)\}>\mu_i^\{(2)\}$ the condition $dS\geq 0$ is met only if
    $dN_i^\{(1)\}<0$

-   If $\mu_i^\{(1)\}<\mu_i^\{(2)\}$ the condition $dS\geq 0$ is met only if
    $dN_i^\{(1)\}>0$

-   Matter flows from high chemical potential to low (not always high
    concentration to low).

### Helmholtz Free Energy

The Helmholtz free energy is a quantity defined by the following
equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
F &= U-\left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial S\}\right)_\{V,N\} S \\
&= U -TS
\end\{aligned\}$$

which has a differential change: $$\begin\{aligned\}
dF &= dU -TdS-SdT \\
&=-SdT-pdV + \sum_\{i=1\}^r\mu_idN_i
\end\{aligned\}$$

    F: System $\to$ $\mathbb\{R\}$

### Gibbs Free Energy

The Gibbs free energy is defined by the following quantity

$$\begin\{aligned\}
G &= U - \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial S\}\right)_\{V,N\}S - \left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial V\}\right)_\{S,N\}V \\
&= U - TS + pV
\end\{aligned\}$$ which has a differential change: $$\begin\{aligned\}
dG &= dU -TdS - SdT + pdV +Vdp \\
&= -SdT +Vdp + \sum_\{i=1\}^r\mu_idN_i 
\end\{aligned\}$$

    G: System $\to$ $\mathbb\{R\}$

## Euler Equation

The internal energy is a homogeneous, first-order function, which
requires that the internal energy must increase linearly with the size
of the system. Mathematically, this is written as:
$$U(\lambda S,\lambda V, \lambda N) = \lambda U(S,V,N)$$

where $\lambda$ is an arbitrary scaling factor for the system size. If
we take the derivative of this equation with respect to $\lambda$, we
arrive at:

$$\frac\{\partial U(\lambda S,\lambda V, \lambda N)\}\{\partial \lambda\} = U(S,V,N)$$

The left-hand side is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\left(\frac\{\partial U(\lambda S,\lambda V, \lambda N)\}\{\partial (\lambda S)\}\right)_\{\lambda V, \lambda N\} \frac\{\partial (\lambda S)\}\{\partial \lambda\} + \left(\frac\{\partial U(\lambda S,\lambda V, \lambda N)\}\{\partial (\lambda V)\}\right)_\{\lambda S, \lambda N\} \frac\{\partial (\lambda V)\}\{\partial \lambda\} + \notag \\
\sum_\{i=1\}^r\left(\frac\{\partial U(\lambda S,\lambda V, \lambda N)\}\{\partial (\lambda N_i)\}\right)_\{\lambda S, \lambda V, \lambda N_\{j \neq i\}\} \frac\{\partial (\lambda N_i)\}\{\partial \lambda\}  = TS - pV + \sum_\{i=1\}^r\mu_iN_i 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the total Legendre Transform equals zero, which is the Euler
equation: $$\label\{Euler equation\}
U = TS -pV +\sum_\{i=1\}^r\mu_iN_i$$
