Classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics provide
powerful tools to model simple systems with a limited number of
microscopic or macroscopic entities. How can we model more complex
macroscale systems with a very large number of possibly interacting
objects? In this chapter we introduce the foundations of statistical
thermodynamics which seeks to understand how the macroscopic behavior of
systems emerges from the microscopic.

We refer to a state determined from either quantum or classical
mechanics as a *microstate*, to distinguish it from a *state* or
*macrostate*, which is a collection of microstates. The macroscopic
state of the system is determined by the probability distribution of the
microstates, that are accessible to a system through its thermal
fluctuations. Our goal then is to find the respective probability of
each microscopic state to the constraints imposed from the perspective
of different ensembles. Once the distribution is found, it is possible
to determine the statistical information of a macrostate. As we will
learn in the rest of this chapter, even when the form of the probability
for each microscopic state might change according to its local ensemble,
the *expectation value*, which defines a macroscopic observable, remains
intact.

## Basic Quantities

An ensemble in statistical mechanics is a probability distribution over
a set of microstates such that every such microstate satisfies relations
defined in terms of the basic quantities.

The probability distribution of the system is defined over the phase
space

$$\begin\{aligned\}
&p_1,\dotsc,p_n \in \mathbb\{R\}^3\\
&q_1,\dotsc,q_n \in \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ This definition can be directly translated to Physika.

    ps : $\mathbb\{R\}^\{3\}[n]$
    qs : $\mathbb\{R\}^\{3\}[n]$
    ClassicalPhaseSpace[n] = ($\mathbb\{R\}^3[n]$, $\mathbb\{R\}^3[n]$)

It's worth noting that the definitions we've given thus far assume that
the phase space of the system has a fixed number of particles $n$. At
times, we will want to model open systems that can have a variable
number of particles. An alternative definition of the phase space

    OpenClassicalPhaseSpace[s] = ($n_1$: $\mathbb\{N\}$,$\dotsc$,$n_s$: $\mathbb\{N\}$, ClassicalPhaseSpace[$\sum_\{i\} n_i$] )

Here there are $s$ kinds of particles and the number of particles of
each type is encoded by $n_i$. The type of the phase space is
parameterized by the total number of particles $$\begin\{aligned\}
n = n_1+\dotsc+n_s
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that `OpenClassicalPhaseSpace` is an example of a
dependent type.

Note that `ClassicalPhaseSpace` and `OpenClassicalPhaseSpace` are very
large uncountable spaces. As a result, phase space is often defined into
tiny cubes $$\begin\{aligned\}
\delta p_1 \times \dotsc \delta p_n \times \delta q_1 \times \dotsc \delta q_n
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can encode this as a type

    Microstate[$\delta$,$n$] = Interval[$\delta$, $\mathbb\{R\}$]$^n$
    Ensemble[$\delta$, $n$] = ProbabilityDistribution[Microstate[$\delta$, $n$]]

This discretization process was viewed classically as a mathematical
hack, but turns out to have deeper meaning in quantum mechanics. Due to
the Heisenberg's uncertainly principle, $\delta$ can be no smaller than
the Planck constant $\hbar$.

Statistical mechanical systems are typically parameterized by some
macroscopic variables defined on phase space: internal energy $U$,
volume $V$, and number of particles $N$, and temperature $T$. We can
define some types for these three quantities.

    System = ClassicalPhaseSpace
    U, V, T: System $\to$ $\mathbb\{R\}$, 

Statistical mechanics studies a series of relationships between these
functions defined on phase space. There are a set of known relationships
that govern interactions between common quantities like internal energy,
temperature, volume, and number of particles. We say that these values
all lie on a common surface defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(U, V, N, T) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Boltzmann entropy is defined as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= k_B \log \Omega
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\Omega$ is the number of microstates
corresponding to a given macrostate. We can parameterize $S$ as a
function of other macroscopic variables $$\begin\{aligned\}
S(U, V, N, T)
\end\{aligned\}$$ The joint surface that all these macroscopic quantities
lies on satisfies a rich set of relationships.

An important aspect of thermodynamics is that many macroscopic
quantities can be expressed in terms of each other. For example, we can
reparameterize the internal energy in terms of the entropy of
$U(S, V, N, T)$. Many results are derived by shifting the choice of
reparameterization.

Another fundamental quantity that we will study is the partition
function.

    Z: PhaseSpace $\to$ $\mathbb\{R\}$

The partition function is arguably the most fundamental quantity in
statistical mechanics. As we will learn in future chapters, all other
quantities can be derived from the partition function by various
formulas.

As a final note, we mention that the physics literature on
thermodynamics follows a particular notation. When we write

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\left ( \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial V\} \right )_T
\end\{aligned\}$$ We mean the derivative of function $f$ with respect to
$V$ with $T$ held constant. This type of notation is useful for
specifying quantities in thermodynamics since we often express
quantities in terms of multiple variables and it may not be clear which
variables may vary and which must be held constant.

### Extensive and Intensive Variables

Macroscopic properties in thermodynamics are classified as either
extensive or intensive. Extensive quantities depend on $N$, the number
of atoms in the system, while intensive quantities don't depend on $N$.
Quantities such as mass, volume, and entropy are extensive, while
temperature is intensive.

There is a conjugate relationship between extensive and intensive
quantities where an extensive change is associated with an associated
intensive quantity change. For example, a change in entropy (extensive)
is tied to a change in temperature (intensive).
