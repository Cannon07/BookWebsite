Mathematical groups represent collections of mathematical
transformations (such as rotations, translations, reflections) abstract.
Representations provide a tool to turn abstract transformations into
concrete matrices. In this chapter, we define the useful notions of
group actions and group representations, which provide tools to study
groups as concrete matrices instead of as abstract mathematical
entities.

## Group Action

A group $G$ is said to act on space $A$ if there exists some function
$$\begin\{aligned\}
G \times A \to A
\end\{aligned\}$$ This function is commonly indicated by $\cdot$ under the
notation $$\begin\{aligned\}
g \cdot a \in A
\end\{aligned\}$$ Group representations furnish a natural group action on
their associated vector spaces $V$.

## Defining Group Representations

For example, a group representation on $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ is given by a map
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho: G \to M_\{n\times n\}(\mathbb\{R\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ We say that $\rho$ must be a group homomorphism that
satisfies the following property $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \rho(g_1g_2) = \rho(g_1)\rho(g_2)
\end\{aligned\}$$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$.

A faithful representation is one which is injective. We can generalize
this notation of representation to the complex numbers $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho: G \to M_\{n \times n\}(\mathbb\{C\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ or even further to an arbitrary vector space $V$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho: G \to M_\{n \times n\}(V)
\end\{aligned\}$$

To provide a concrete example, consider the group of 3 elements,
$$\begin\{aligned\}
H &= \{1, u, u^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
u &= e^\{2\pi i / 3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We define $\rho: H \to M_\{2 \times 2\}(\mathbb\{C\})$ by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho(0) &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 
\end\{pmatrix\}\\
\rho(u) &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
1 & 0 \\
0 & u 
\end\{pmatrix\} \\
\rho(u^2) &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
1 & 0 \\
0 & u^2 
\end\{pmatrix\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ You will show in the exercises that $\rho$ is a group
representation.

## Irreducible Representations

Suppose that $W$ is a vector subspace of $V$ which is invariant under
the group representation $\rho$. That is, if $w \in W$, we have that for
all group elements $g \in G$, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho(g) w \in W
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, the matrices $\rho(g)$ map elements of $W$ back
into $W$. We can then say that $W$ provides a subrepresentation of
$\rho$. We say that $V$ provides an irreducible representation if there
do not exist any subrepresentations. Irreducible representations are
very useful since reducible representations can be decomposed into a sum
of irreducible representations. For this reason, irreducible
representations furnish the \"atomic\" elements of representations. In
fact, there is a deep connection between particles and representation
theory given by Wigner's theorem.

## Exercises

1.  Prove that $H$ is a group.

2.  Prove that $\rho$ acting on $H$ defined above is a group
    representation.
