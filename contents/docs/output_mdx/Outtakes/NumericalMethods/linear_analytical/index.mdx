In this chapter we will learn how to solve small sets of linear
equations with graphical methods. We will then explain how to evaluate
the determinant of a matrix and solve linear equations with Cramer's
rule. Finally we will explain how to eliminate unknowns in equations by
combining equations.

## Graphical Methods

For a system of two variables, graphical method obtains solutions by
plotting them on Cartesian coordinates with one axis corresponding to
$x_1$ and the other to $x_2$. The values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ at the
intersection of two lines represent the solution. Consider the example:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
3x_1 + 2x_2 &= 18\\
-x_1 + 2x_2 &= 2
\end\{aligned\}$$ Solving for $x_2$ in terms of $x_1$, we get
$$\begin\{aligned\}
x_2 = \dfrac\{1\}\{2\}x_1 + 1
\end\{aligned\}$$

As shown in Figure [\[fig:1\]](#fig:1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:1"\}, two lines intersect at $x_1$ = 4 and $x_2$ = 3 which
therefore is the solution for the example considered.

For three simultaneous equations, each equation would be represented by
a plane in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The point where the
three planes intersect would represent the solution. For systems with
more than three equations, graphical methods cannot be applied. Some
other cases that can pose problems when solving sets of linear equations
are as follows.

-   *Singular systems*

    1.  When two equations represent parallel lines, there is no
        solution as they never intersect.

    2.  When two lines are coincident, there is an infinite number of
        solutions.

-   *Ill-conditioned systems*: When the slopes are so close that it is
    difficult to detect the point of intersection. This system is very
    close to being singular. Also this system is extremely sensitive to
    round-off error.

## Determinants and Cramer's Rule

Consider a system of three equations defined as $[A]$ $\left\{x\right\}$
= $\left\{b\right\}$ where $[A]$ is the coefficient matrix. The
determinant of square matrix \[A\] is formed from its elements and is
represented by D. $$\begin\{aligned\}
[A] &=
\begin\{bmatrix\}
    a_\{11\} & a_\{12\} & a_\{13\} \\ 
    a_\{21\} & a_\{22\} & a_\{23\} \\ 
    a_\{31\} & a_\{32\} & a_\{33\}
\end\{bmatrix\}\\
D &= 
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{11\} & a_\{12\} & a_\{13\} \\ 
a_\{21\} & a_\{22\} & a_\{23\} \\ 
a_\{31\} & a_\{32\} & a_\{33\}
\end\{vmatrix\}
\vspace\{-6pt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Determinant is a single number as compared to a matrix.
For a system of two simultaneous equations, determinant is computed as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
D =
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{11\} & a_\{12\} \\ 
a_\{21\} & a_\{22\}  
\end\{vmatrix\}
= a_\{11\} a_\{22\} - a_\{12\} a_\{21\}
\vspace\{-8pt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ For the above matrix \[A\], determinant D is calculated
as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
D = a_\{11\}
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{22\} & a_\{23\} \\ 
a_\{32\} & a_\{33\} 
\end\{vmatrix\}
- a_\{12\}
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{21\} & a_\{23\} \\ 
a_\{31\} & a_\{33\}  
\end\{vmatrix\} 
+ a_\{13\}
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{21\} & a_\{22\} \\ 
a_\{31\} & a_\{32\}  
\end\{vmatrix\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where the $2\times2$ determinants are called *minors*.

::: example
Consider a three loop current network with five resistors and two
voltage sources as shown in Figure
[\[fig:2\]](#fig:2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:2"\}.The
electrical network consists of 5 resistors (R), two voltage sources (v)
and three unknown currents in each loop (i). Given that $R_1$ = 3
$\Omega$, $R_2$ = 5 $\Omega$, $R_3$ = 2 $\Omega$, $R_4$ = 3 $\Omega$,
$R_5$ = 8 $\Omega$, $v_1$ = 5 V and $v_2$ = 3 V. Set up a system of
linear equations for this problem which will be solved for the three
unknowns $i_1$, $i_2$ and $i_3$ using Cramer's rule. First evaluate
determinant of the coefficient matrix for this system by hand and using
MATLAB. *Solution*: Applying Kirchoff's current law and Ohm's law for
the three current loops we get the following. $$\begin\{aligned\}
-3 + 3i_1 + 5(i_1 - i_2) &= 0\\
5(i_2 - i_1) + 2i_2 + 3(i_2 - i_3)&= 0\\
3(i_3 - i_2) + 8i_3 + 3 &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ These equations can be simplified to obtain the
following system of linear equations. $$\begin\{aligned\}
8i_1 - 5i_2  &= 5\\
-5i_1  + 10i_2 - 3i_3 &= 0\\
-3i_2 + 11i_3 &= -3
\end\{aligned\}$$

1.  Manually $$D = 8
    \begin\{vmatrix\}
    10 & -3 \\ 
     -3 & 11  
    \end\{vmatrix\}
    - (-5)
    \begin\{vmatrix\}
    -5 & -3 \\ 
    0 & 11 
    \end\{vmatrix\} 
    + 0
    \begin\{vmatrix\}
    -5 & 10 \\ 
    0 & -3 
    \end\{vmatrix\} 
    \vspace\{-2pt\}$$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    D = 8[(10)11 - (-3)(-3)]+5[(-5)11 - 0(-3)]+0[-5(-3) - 0(10)] = 533
    \end\{aligned\}$$

2.  MATLAB: Determinant can be computed directly in MATLAB with the
    `det` function.

        >> A=[8 -5 0;-5 10 -3;0 -3 11];
        >> D=det(A)
        D = 533

Note that the determinant of a singular system is zero and a
ill-conditioned system is almost close to zero. **Cramer's Rule**: Using
this rule for a system of three linear equations, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$
would be computed as $$x_1 =\dfrac\{
\begin\{vmatrix\}
b_1 & a_\{12\} & a_\{13\} \\ 
b_2 & a_\{22\} & a_\{23\} \\ 
b_3 & a_\{32\} & a_\{33\}
\end\{vmatrix\}
\}\{D\},
x_2 =\dfrac\{
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{11\} & b_1 & a_\{13\} \\ 
a_\{21\} & b_2 & a_\{23\} \\ 
a_\{31\} & b_3 & a_\{33\}
\end\{vmatrix\}
\}\{D\},
x_3 =\dfrac\{
\begin\{vmatrix\}
a_\{11\} & a_\{12\} & b_1 \\ 
a_\{21\} & a_\{22\} & b_2 \\ 
a_\{31\} & a_\{32\} & b_3
\end\{vmatrix\}
\}\{D\}$$

::::: example
Use Cramer's rule to solve for the three unknowns $i_1$, $i_2$ and $i_3$
in the above example by hand and using MATLAB.\

1.  Manually\
    As already evaluated, determinant D = 533. Therefore $$i_1 =\dfrac\{
        \begin\{vmatrix\}
        5 & -5 & 0 \\ 
        0 & 10 & -3 \\ 
        -3 & -3 & 11
        \end\{vmatrix\}
    \}\{533\}, i_2 =\dfrac\{
        \begin\{vmatrix\}
        8 & 5 & 0 \\ 
        -5 & 0 & -3 \\ 
        0 & -3 & 11
        \end\{vmatrix\}
    \}\{533\}, i_3 =\dfrac\{
        \begin\{vmatrix\}
        8 & -5 & 5 \\ 
        -5 & 10 & 0 \\ 
        0 & -3 & -3
        \end\{vmatrix\}
    \}\{533\} 
    \vspace\{-6pt\}$$ Which when simplified we get $i_1$ = 0.863 A $i_2$ =
    0.3809 A and $i_3$ = -0.1689 A.

2.  MATLAB:

        D=det(A);
        A1 = A; A1(:,1) = b;
        A2 = A; A2(:,2) = b;
        A3 = A; A3(:,3) = b;
        x1 = det(A1)/D;
        x2 = det(A2)/D;
        x3 = det(A3)/D;

::: marginfigure
    A=[8 -5 0;-5 10 -3;0 -3 11];
    b=[5;0;-3];
:::

::: marginfigure
*Output:*

    x1 = 0.8630
    x2 = 0.3809
    x3 = -0.1689

Note: For more than three equations, Cramer's rule becomes impractical
because, as the number of equations increases, the determinants are time
consuming to evaluate by hand (or by MATLAB).

## Elimination of Unknowns

Consider the system of two equations from graphical method as shown
below $$\begin\{aligned\}
3x_1 + 2x_2 &= 18\\
-x_1 + 2x_2 = 2
\end\{aligned\}$$ The idea behind this method is to multiply the equations
by constants so that one of the unknowns will be eliminated when the two
equations are combined. We will be left with one equation from which one
of the unknowns is evaluated and then that is substituted back into the
original equation to solve for the other unknown. Multiplying first
equation with -1 and second equation with 3 we get $$\begin\{aligned\}
-3x_1 - 2x_2 = -18\\
-3x_1 + 6x_2 = 6
\end\{aligned\}$$ Subtracting, $-8x_2 = -24$ and therefore $x_2 = 3$.
Substituting this in the first equation we get, $$\begin\{aligned\}
-3x_1 - 2(3) &= -18\\
x_1 &= 4
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note: The elimination of unknowns can be extended to
systems with more than two or three equations. However, the numerous
calculations that are required for larger systems make the method
extremely tedious to implement by hand.
