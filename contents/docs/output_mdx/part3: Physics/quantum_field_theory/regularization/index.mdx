Many observable quantities in quantum field theory lead to infinite
quantities. Regularization is a family of techniques used to control
these infinities through the use of a finite quantity called the
regulator.

## Pauli-Villars Regularization

This technique introduces a fictitious mass term into integrals.
Consider the photon propagator in momentum space $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{k^2 + i \epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This propagator is replaced by the propagator
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{k^2 + i\epsilon\} - \frac\{1\}\{k^2 - \Lambda^2 + i\epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $\Lambda$ is viewed as a fictitious heavy mass.

## Dimensional Regularization

Dimensional regularization writes a Feynman integral as a function that
depends on the spacetime dimension $d$. By assuming that dimension is a
continuous complex variable, the function can be analytically continued
to all of the complex plane, including at points at which the original
integral was singular. The value of this analytic continuation is used
as a reasonable proxy for the originally singular integral.

Consider the following loop integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int \frac\{d^4 p\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \frac\{1\}\{(p^2 + m^2)^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here the integral is explicitly set for $d=4$. We
rewrite this integral to be in terms of $d$ explicitly $$\begin\{aligned\}
\int \frac\{d^d p\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \frac\{1\}\{(p^2 + m^2)^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ If the function $f$ only depends on $p^2$, then we have
the radial identity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int d^d p f(p^2) &= \frac\{(2\pi)^\{d/2\}\}\{\Gamma(d/2)\} \int_0^\infty p^\{d-1\} f(p^2)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us consider the case where $d = 4 - \epsilon$ where
$\epsilon$ is considered to be a small quantity. Then we can evaluate
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{(2\pi)^\{(4-\epsilon)/2\}\}\{\Gamma(\frac\{4 - \epsilon\}\{2\})\} \int_0^\infty \frac\{d^\{4-\epsilon\}p\}\{(2\pi)^\{4-\epsilon\}\} \frac\{p^\{3-\epsilon\}\}\{(p^2 +m^2)^2 \} &= \frac\{2^\{\epsilon - 4\}\pi^\{\epsilon/2 -1\}\}\{\sin(\frac\{\pi \epsilon\}\{2\}\Gamma(1 - \epsilon/2)\} m^\{-\epsilon\} \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{8\pi^2\epsilon\} - \frac\{1\}\{16\pi^2\} \left (\ln \frac\{m^2\}\{4\pi\} _ \gamma \right ) + O(\epsilon)
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Zeta Function Regularization

Sometimes we have energy quantities of the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \sum_m \frac\{\hbar |\omega_n|\}\{2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ If $\omega_n$ doesn't decay fast enough, this sum will
diverge. We can instead choose to evaluate the quantity
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \sum_m \frac\{\hbar |\omega_n|\}\{2\}|\omega_n|^\{-s\}
\end\{aligned\}$$
