In this chapter we provide a brief introduction to the quantum mechanics
of superconductors. A superconductor is a special system which is both a
perfect conductor and which expels external magnetic fields.

## BCS Theory

The BCS theory provides a basic model of superconductivity by modeling
the interactions between electrons and phonons in the system. In
particular, phonons mediate an attractive electron-electron
interactions. These interacting pairs are called Cooper pairs. This
system can be modeled by an attractive potential $V(r_1 - r_2)$ where
$r_1$ and $r_2$ are the positions of two electrons.

Superconductivity occurs when this attractive force dominates the
repulsive force from the Coulomb potential. The BCS theory also
successfully predicts the second order phase transition at the critical
temperature $T_c$.

## Superconducting Density Functional Theory

A successful computational strategy to model superconductivity has been
to use density functional theory with a custom exchange-correlation
functional to model superconducting systems.
