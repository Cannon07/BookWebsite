By symmetry here, we mean the invariance or equivariance of a function
under a particular group.

## Meta Learning Symmetries by Reparameterization

## Symmetry Discovery

![LieGAN
Architecture](figures/Differentiable Physics/Meshes ML/generative_adversarial_symmetry/liegan.png)\{#fig:enter-label\}

Optimize the KL divergence.

### Parameterizing Distribution

Parameterize the distribution over the continuous Lie group.
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    w &= \exp \left [ \sum_i w_i L_i \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Discovering Symmetry in Predictions

Symmetries in form of Lie algebra bases. Can be plugged into many
existing designs.

E-GNN enforces $E(n)$ symmetry by invariant features. This is restricted
to Euclidean groups only, but we want a more general implementation.

We can compute a group invariant metric tensor. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \|u\|_J &= \sqrt\{u^T J u\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Discovering Symmetry in 2-Body Trajectory

This has $SO(2)$ symmetry. LieGAN discovers the correct symmetry from
trajectories. The discovered symmetry can be used in prediciton.

## Discovering Lorentz Symmetry in Top Quark Tagging

The LieGAN can recover the Lorentz symmetry in this case as an
approximate restricted group symmetry. Reaches near the performance of
LorentzNet

## Regularize Latent Representation

Use an orthogonal output layer.

### Reaction-Diffusion Systems

### Lotke-Volterra Equations

There are no linear-symmetries of this system.

### Joint Discovery of Governing Equations

Want to find a symbolic and parsimonious governing equation. Use the
SINDy Autoencoder to find a latent space.

## Future Works

Extend to local symmetry groups. Also want to study conservation
