Laplace's equation is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 f &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ In the case that the boundary condition is given by some
function $h$, we have Poisson's equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 f &= h
\end\{aligned\}$$ Poisson's equation arises in electrostatic systems in
the following manner. Let $V$ denote the electric potential. Suppose
that we have some charge density $\rho$. Then the following equation
holds true

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 V &= -\frac\{\rho\}\{\varepsilon_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

In general, we assume that $\rho$ is a known function and we face the
problem of recovering $V$.

## Green's Function Methods

Green's functions provide a powerful tool for solving Laplace's
equations and Poisson's equations. We seek a function $G$ which
satisfies the property

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 G(x, x') =  \delta(x-x') 
\end\{aligned\}$$ We claim that this Green's function is given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
G(x, x') &= -\frac\{1\}\{4\pi\} \frac\{1\}\{|x - x'|\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Then the solution $V$ for an arbitrary charge potential $\rho$ is given
by $$\begin\{aligned\}
V(x) &= \int_\{x'\} G(x, x') \rho(x') dx'
\end\{aligned\}$$ In principle this allows for the solution of arbitrary
Poisson's equation problems. In practice, the integral may be
challenging to compute. However, we see that this is an integral
program, so we may use numerical integration to obtain a numerical
solution.
