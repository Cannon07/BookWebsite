In this chapter we study the scattering reaction $$\begin\{aligned\}
    e^+e^- \mapsto \mu^+\mu^-
\end\{aligned\}$$

This diagram has the following amplitude

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{M\} &= \bar\{v\}^\{s'\}(p')(-ie\gamma^\{\mu\})u^s(p)\left ( \frac\{-ig_\{\mu\nu\}\}\{q^2\}\right ) \bar\{u\}^r(k)(-ie\gamma^\nu)v^\{r'\}(k')
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Real Space Feynman Rules

Terms are computed from Feynman diagrams according to the Feynman rules.
We list the Feynman rules for QED

-   Integration coordinates $x_j$ are represented by vertices

-   Bosonic propagators are represented by wiggly lines connecting two
    vertices.

-   Fermionic propagators are represented by straight lines connecting
    two vertices.

-   A bosonic field $A_\mu(x_i)$ is given by a wiggly line attached to a
    point.

-   A fermionic field $\psi(x_i)$ is given by a straight line attached
    to a point with the arrow towards the point.

-   An anti-fermionic field $\overline\{\psi\}(x_i)$ is given by a
    straight line attached to the point with the arrow pointed away from
    the point.

## Momentum Space Feynman Rules

It is often useful to compute Feynman rules in momentum space rather
than in real space. Analogous transformations of these rules exist for
momentum space.
