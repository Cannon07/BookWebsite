In this chapter, we analyze the thermodynamics of photon gas, which
constitutes the description of the radiation properties of Black Bodies.
Here we consider an electromagnetic field in thermal equilibrium with
its container. Under this condition, quantum theory predicts that the
Hamiltonian of the system can be written as a sum of terms, each having
the form of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, the energy of each photon is
given by $\hslash\omega$. This provides our starting point for the
derivation of all the thermodynamic properties of photons from the basis
of statistical mechanics. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of
photon gases, some fundamental laws for Blackbody Radiation will be
obtained, such as Planck's Law, Wien's Law, Rayleigh-Jeans law, and
Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

## Black Body Radiation

We are all familiar with the idea that hot objects emit radiation, a
light bulb, for example. In the hot wire filament, an electron,
originally in an excited state drops to a lower energy state and the
energy difference is given off as a photon,
($\epsilon = h\nu = \epsilon_2 -\epsilon_1$). We are also familiar with
the absorption of radiation by surfaces. For example, clothes in the
summer absorb photons from the sun and heat up. Black clothes absorb
more radiation than lighter ones. This means, of course that lighter
colored clothes reflect a larger fraction of the light falling on them.

A black body is defined as one which absorbs all the radiation incident
upon it, *i.e.* a perfect absorber. It also emits the radiation
subsequently. If radiation is falling on a black body, its temperature
rises until it reaches equilibrium with the radiation. At equilibrium,
it re-emits as much radiation as it absorbs so there is no net gain in
energy and the temperature remains constant. In this case, the surface
is in equilibrium with the radiation and the temperature of the surface
must be the same as the temperature of the radiation.

To develop the idea of radiation temperature we construct an enclosure
having walls which are perfect absorbers (see
Fig. [\[fig8\]](#fig8)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig8"\}). Inside
the enclosure is radiation. Eventually this radiation reaches
equilibrium with the enclosure walls, equal amounts are emitted and
absorbed by the walls. Also, the amount of radiation travelling in each
direction becomes equal and is uniform. In this case the radiation may
be regarded as a gas of photons in equilibrium having a uniform
temperature. The enclosure is then called an isothermal enclosure.

An enclosure of this type containing a small hole is itself a black
body. Any radiation passing through the hole will be absorbed. The
radiation emitted from the hole is characteristic of a black body at the
temperature of the photon gas. The properties of the emitted radiation
is then independent of the materials of the wall provided they are
sufficiently absorbing that essentially all radiation entering the hole
is absorbed. This universal radiation is called Black Body Radiation.

An everyday example of a photon gas is the background radiation in the
universe. This photon gas is at a temperature of about 5 $K$. Thus the
earth's surface, at a temperature of about 300 $K$, is not in
equilibrium with this gas. The earth is a net emitter of radiation
(excluding the sun) and this is why it is dark at night and why it is
coldest on clear nights when there is no cloud cover to increase the
reflection of the earth's radiation back to the earth. A second example
is a Bessemer converter used in steel manufacture containing molten
steel. These vessels actually contain holes like the isothermal
enclosure of Fig. [\[fig8\]](#fig8)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig8"\}. The radiation emitted from the hole is used in steel
making to measure the temperature in the vessel, by means of an optical
pyrometer.

## Statistical Thermodynamics

To derive Planck's radiation law directly from our statistical
mechanics, we note that number of photons in the gas is not fixed. The
photons are absorbed and re-emitted by the enclosure walls. Since the
photons are non-interacting it is by this absorption and re-emission
that equilibrium is maintained in the gas. Since, also the free energy
$F(T, V, N)$ is constant in equilibrium (at constant $T$ and $V$ ) while
N varies it follows that $\partial F/\partial N = 0$, that is
$$\mu = \frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial N\}\bigg|_\{V,N\} = 0 \notag$$

The photon gas is then a Bose gas with $\mu= 0$, so that the canonical
partition function is given directly as $$\label\{Part_photon\}
Q = \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...s_j,... = 0\}^\infty e^\{- \beta \sum_\{l=1\}^\infty s_l\epsilon_l\} = \prod_\{s=1\}^\infty \frac\{1\}\{1-e^\{-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta\}\}$$

Similarly to our previous treatment for phonons, we express the average
energy of the system per unit of volume $\langle E\rangle/V$ considering
a continuum distribution of energies: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Energy_Density\}
\frac\{\langle E \rangle\}\{V\} = -\frac\{1\}\{V\}\frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial \beta\} &= \frac\{1\}\{V\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\infty \frac\{\epsilon_le^\{-\beta\epsilon_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\epsilon_l\}\} \notag\\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac\{1\}\{V\}g(\epsilon)  \frac\{\epsilon\}\{e^\{\beta\epsilon\}-1\} d\epsilon \notag\\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac\{1\}\{V\}\epsilon(\nu)g(\nu)\bar\{n\}(\nu) d\nu
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\epsilon=h\nu$, according to the energy states defined by the
quantum theory of electromagnetic field;
$g(\nu)=\frac\{4\pi V\}\{c_0^3\}\nu^2$ is the density of states, and
$\bar\{n\}(\nu)$ is the Bose occupation given by:
$$\bar\{n\}(\nu) = \frac\{1\}\{\exp(\epsilon_\{s\}\beta)-1\} \notag$$

The integrand from
([\[Energy_Density\]](#Energy_Density)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Energy_Density"\}) can be expressed as: $$\label\{Planck\}
u(\nu) = \frac\{8\pi\}\{c^\{3\}\}\frac\{h\nu\}\{\exp(\beta h\nu)-1\}\nu^\{2\}$$

Which is Planck's Radiation Law. We may also recover Wien and
Rayleigh-Jeans laws as limits of Planck's law,

1.  Long wavelength, $\frac\{hc\}\{kT\lambda\} << 1$. Here $$\label\{Eq29\}
    \bar\{\epsilon\}= \frac\{hc/\lambda\}\{\exp(hc/kT\lambda)-1\} \simeq kT$$

    And ([\[Eq29\]](#Eq29)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq29"\})
    becomes $$\label\{Eq30\}
    u(\lambda)= \frac\{1\}\{V\} \bar\{\epsilon\}(\lambda) g(\lambda) \simeq \frac\{8 \pi\}\{\lambda^\{4\}\} kT$$

    Which is Wien's law valid at long wavelengths.

2.  Short wavelength, $\frac\{hc\}\{kT\lambda\} >> 1$. Here $$\label\{Eq31\}
    \bar\{\epsilon\}= \frac\{hc\}\{\lambda\} \exp(-hc/kT\lambda)$$

    And ([\[Eq30\]](#Eq30)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq30"\})
    becomes $$\label\{Eq32\}
    u(\lambda)= \frac\{1\}\{V\} \bar\{\epsilon\}(\lambda) g(\lambda) \simeq \frac\{8 \pi hc\}\{\lambda^\{5\}\} \exp(-hc/kT\lambda)$$

    Which is the Wien's law valid at short wavelength.

Employing our statistical mechanics we readily obtained Planck's
radiation law.

We may also derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law for: $$\label\{Eq33\}
u = \int_0^\{\infty\} u(\nu) d\nu = \frac\{8\pi\}\{c^\{3\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} \frac\{h\nu\}\{\exp(\beta h\nu)-1\}\nu^\{2\}d\nu$$

Introducing $x=\beta h\nu$, this reduces to $$\label\{Eq34\}
u = \frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} dx \frac\{x^\{3\}\}\{\exp(x)-1\} T^\{4\} = aT^\{4\}$$

Where $$\label\{Eq35\}
a = \frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \frac\{\pi^\{4\}\}\{15\}$$

In this way we obtain, using statistical mechanics, a law derived
previously using thermodynamics including all the numerical factors.
This gives Stefan's constant $\sigma$ in $$\label\{Eq36\}
E = \frac\{1\}\{4\} caT^\{4\} = \sigma T^\{4\}$$

As $$\label\{Eq37\}
\sigma =  \frac\{2\pi ck^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \frac\{\pi^\{4\}\}\{15\} = 5.67 \times 10^\{-5\} \frac\{erg\}\{cm^\{2\}-Sec-K^\{4\}\}$$

A measurement of $\sigma$ could then be used, for example, to determine
Planck's constant. Planck, in fact, determined h as the constant needed
in his radiation law to fit the observed spectral distribution law. This
gave him the value h = 6.55 $\times$ 10$^\{-27\}$ erg.sec which compares
with the present value of h = 6.625 $\times$ 10$^\{-27\}$ erg.sec

## Thermodynamic Properties of Photons

We may calculate all the thermodynamic properties of black body
radiation using statistical mechanics through the partition function
$Q$, where $$\label\{Eq38\}
F =  -kT\log(Q)$$

And $Q$ was derived as shown in
([\[Part_photon\]](#Part_photon)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Part_photon"\}). This is the basic method of statistical
thermodynamics. The aim is to reproduce all the thermodynamic properties
with all factors and constants evaluated. This gives $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq39\}
F &=  -kT\log\left(\prod_\{s=1\}^\{r\} (1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\}\right) \notag \\
F &=  -kT\sum_\{s=1\}^\{r\} \log(1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\} \notag \\
F &= -2kT  \int \frac\{d\Gamma\}\{h^\{3\}\} \log (1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where the $\epsilon_\{s\}$ are the single photon states and the factor of
2 arises from the two polarizations available to each photon. This can
be integrated in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most direct is to
integrate over phase space $(d\Gamma=dV\,\,4\pi p^\{2\}\,\,dp)$ and write
$\epsilon=pc$. Introducing the dimensionless variable
$x = \beta \epsilon = \beta pc$, the Helmholtz free energy is:
$$\label\{Eq40\}
F = -\frac\{1\}\{3\} \left\lbrace -\frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} d(x)^\{3\} \,\, \log(1-\exp(-x)) \right\rbrace \,\, VT^\{4\}$$

The dimensionless integral here can be transformed into that appearing
in the constant of $a$ of ([\[Eq35\]](#Eq35)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq35"\}), by an integration by parts, i.e., $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq41\}
I &= -  \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} d(x)^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) \notag \\
&= - (x^\{3\}) \log(1-\exp(-x))\bigg|_\{0\}^\{\infty\} + \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} x^\{3\} d[\log(1-\exp(-x))]
\end\{aligned\}$$

The first term vanishes because:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\lim_\{x \to \infty\} x^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) &\simeq \lim_\{x \to \infty\} x^\{3\} \exp(-x) = 0 \\
\lim_\{x \to 0\} x^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) &\simeq \lim_\{x \to 0\} x^\{3\} \log(x) = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

And $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq42\}
I &= \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} dx \frac\{x^\{3\}\}\{\exp(x)-1\} = \frac\{\pi\}\{15\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Comparing ([\[Eq40\]](#Eq40)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq40"\}) and
([\[Eq35\]](#Eq35)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq35"\}), we get:
$$\label\{Eq43\}
F = -\frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\}$$

From F we may determine all other thermodynamic properties by
differentiation. For example, the entropy is $$\label\{Eq44\}
S = -\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial T\}\right) \bigg|_\{V\} = \frac\{4\}\{3\} aVT^\{3\}$$

The internal energy is: $$\label\{Eq45\}
U = F +TS = avT^\{4\}$$

The pressure is: $$\label\{Eq46\}
p = -\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial V\}\right) \bigg|_\{T\}  = \frac\{1\}\{3\} aT^\{4\}$$

Finally, the Gibbs free energy is: s $$\label\{Eq47\}
G = F + pV =  - \frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\} + \frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\} = 0$$

This is zero as required $G=\mu N$ and the chemical potential $\mu=0$.
We may use these expressions to further verify thermodynamic
consistency, for example that
$C_\{V\} = T\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial T\}\bigg|_\{V\}= \frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial T\}\bigg|_\{V\}$.

In summary, we have obtained the spectral distribution from the Bose
occupation in much the same way as we obtained the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution for a classical gas. The only other required ingredient was
the density of states. We have also obtained all the thermodynamic
properties using the partition function $Q$.
