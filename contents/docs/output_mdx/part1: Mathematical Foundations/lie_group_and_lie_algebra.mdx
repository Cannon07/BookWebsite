Lie groups (pronounced \"Lee\") are mathematical groups that are also
differentiable manifolds. Lie groups arise repeatedly in quantum
mechanics as the correct structure to model continuous groups of
transformations. As we will see in this chapter, the group of rotations
in three dimensions is given by $\mathrm\{SO\}(3)$, a Lie group. Or the
group of distance preserving transformations is given by
$\mathrm\{E\}(3)$. Another foundational concept is that of the
representation of Lie groups

## Definitions

A real Lie group is a group which is also a finite-dimensional real
smooth manifold. The group is written multiplicatively, and the group
operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps on the
manifold. Formally, the map $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mu:G \times G \to G \quad \mu(x, y) = xy
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a smooth map from the product manifold $G \times G$
to $G$.

Consider the set of $2 \times 2$ invertible matrices $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \textrm\{GL\}(2, \mathbb\{R\}) &= \left \{A = \begin\{pmatrix\} a & b \\ c & d \end\{pmatrix\} | \det A \neq 0\right \} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ We claim that $\textrm\{GL\}(2, \mathbb\{R\})$ is a Lie
group. More generally, $\textrm\{GL\}(n, \mathbb\{R\})$ of $n \times n$
invertible matrices is a Lie group as is $\textrm\{GL\}(n, \mathbb\{C\})$.
So too are the special linear groups of matrices with determinant $1$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \textrm\{SL\}(n, \mathbb\{R\}) &= \{ A \in M_\{n\times n\}(\mathbb\{R\}) | \det A = 1 \} \\
    \textrm\{SL\}(n, \mathbb\{C\}) &= \{ A \in M_\{n\times n\}(\mathbb\{C\}) | \det A = 1 \} \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ The orthogonal and special orthogonal groups of
orthogonal real matrices form a Lie group $$\begin\{aligned\}
    O(n) &= \{ A \in M_\{n \times n\}(\mathbb\{R\}) | \det A \neq 0, A^T = A^\{-1\} \} \\
    SO(n) &= \{ A \in M_\{n \times n\}(\mathbb\{R\}) | \det A = 1, A^T = A^\{-1\} \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ as do the unitary and special unitary groups of complex
matrices. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(n) &= \{ U \in M_\{n \times n\}(\mathbb\{C\}) | \det U \neq 0, U^* = U^\{-1\} \} \\
    SU(n) &= \{ U \in M_\{n \times n\}(\mathbb\{C\}) | \det U = 1, U^T = U^\{-1\} \}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Lie Algebras

Every Lie group has associated with it the associated Lie algebra.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \textrm\{Lie\}(G) &= \{ X \in M(n, \mathbb\{C\}) | \textrm\{exp\}(t X) \in G, \ \forall t \in \mathbb\{R\} \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This algebra has with it an associated bracket structure
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [X, Y] &= XY - YX
\end\{aligned\}$$
