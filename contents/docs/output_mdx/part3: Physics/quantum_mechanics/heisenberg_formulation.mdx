The Heisenberg formulation provides an alternative mathematical
representation to the Schrodinger formulation that centers evolution of
operators instead of evolution of state vectors. In the Schrodinger
evolution we might say that a system evolves by a unitary transformation
$U$ meaning that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    |\alpha\rangle \mapsto U|\alpha \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that unitary transformations preserve the inner
product so that we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle \alpha | \beta \rangle &\mapsto \langle \alpha | U^\dagger U | \beta \rangle \\
&= \langle \alpha | \beta \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ Suppose now that we have an arbitrary operator $X$. How
does this operator evolve under unitary evolution? $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle \alpha | X | \beta \rangle \mapsto \langle \alpha U^\dagger X U | \beta \rangle 
\end\{aligned\}$$ This suggests that the operator $X$ evolves by the
following rule $$\begin\{aligned\}
    X \mapsto U^\dagger X U
\end\{aligned\}$$ Suppose now that $A$ is an observable in the Schrodinger
formulation. We can apply this rule to retrieve the observable in the
Heisenberg formulation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    A^H(t) \mapsto U^\dagger(t) A U(t)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that $A^H(t)$ varies in time. we can then obtain
what is called the Heisenberg equation of motion by differentiation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{dA^H(t)\}\{dt\} &= \frac\{i\}\{\hbar\} [H_H, A_H(t)] + \left (\frac\{\partial A_S\}\{\partial t\} \right )_H \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{i\hbar\}[A^H, U^\dagger U U] \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{i\hbar\}[A^H, H]
\end\{aligned\}$$
