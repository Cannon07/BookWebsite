Spatial graph convolutions use the three dimensional structure of the
molecule in the computed representation.

\"The arc of drug discovery entails a multiparameter optimization
problem spanning vast length scales. Through feature learning---instead
of feature engineering---deep neural networks promise to outperform both
traditional physics-based and knowledge-based machine learning models
for predicting molecular properties pertinent to drug discovery. To this
end, we present the PotentialNet family of graph convolutions.
Alongside, predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination,
and toxicity (ADMET) properties has therefore been of great interest to
the computational chemistry and medicinal chemistry communities in
recent decades. Here, we learn the features most relevant to each
chemical task at hand by representing each molecule explicitly as a
graph. By applying graph convolutions to this explicit molecular
representation, we achieve, to our knowledge, unprecedented accuracy in
prediction of ADMET properties.\"
