A fiber bundle is a type of mathematical space that associates to each
point on a given base space a \"fiber\" space. We have encountered a few
simple examples of fiber bundles before, notably the tangent bundle
$\mathcal\{T\}M$ over a manifold $M$ and the cotangent bundle
$\mathcal\{T\}^*M$. Mathematically, a fiber bundle is defined by a
projection map $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \pi: E \to B
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here, $\pi$ is a surjection, $B$ is the base space, and
$\pi$ is defined such that in local regions of $E$, $\pi$ behaves like
the projection map $B \times F \to B$ where $F$ is the fiber space. We
say that $\pi^\{-1\}(x)$ is the fiber over point $x$.

## Examples

The formal mathematical definition of a fiber bundle is complex so we
start with examples to build understanding.

### Trivial Bundle

Let $E = B \times F$ and let $\pi$ be the projection onto the first
coordinate. In this case, $\pi: E \to B$ is called the trivial bundle.

### Vector Bundle

In the case that the fiber $F$ is a vector space, we say that the fiber
bundle is a vector bundle. The tangent bundle $\mathcal\{T\}M$ and
cotangent bundle $\mathcal\{T\}^*M$ are vector bundles.

### Principle Bundle

Suppose we have a fiber bundle $\pi: E \to B$. Let $G$ be a group and
suppose we have a continuous right group action $$\begin\{aligned\}
P \times G \to P
\end\{aligned\}$$ such that the group action preserves the fibers. That
is, if $y \in \pi^\{-1\}(x)$ then for all $g \in G$, we have
$y \cdot g \in \pi^\{-1\}(x)$.

## Section

A section of a fiber bundle is a map $$\begin\{aligned\}
    f: B \to E
\end\{aligned\}$$ such that $\pi(f(x)) = x$. That is, a section maps every
point on the base space to a point in the fiber \"above\" it.
