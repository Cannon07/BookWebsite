Graph neural networks can be used for the tasks of reconstruction,
tagging, generation, and end-to-end analysis.

In particular, graph neural networks have found a niche in analyzing
particle accelerator data to perform useful tasks like identifying jets.
Architectures for this task need to consider useful physical properties
of jets which may be used to narrow down those phenomena which merit
deeper consideration.

## Reconstruction and Identification

Raw data from particle accelerators can take the form of a point cloud.
A graph of relationships between these events has to be reconstructed.
Traditionally this is done with heuristic methods, but this can be done
with graph networks.

Reconstruction approaches often build on a clustering task and may
follow the form of edge strength prediction which predicts the weight of
a node to node edge. Calorimeter applications focus on segmentation,
with tasks like partial assignment of hits to showers.

Identification tasks focus on graph classification or segmentation. A
common task is jet classification, which seeks to identify the particle
that triggered a jet. Graph networks have proven useful in identifying
jets and reconstructing their dynamics from the raw data.

## Generative Modeling

Generative models are useful for creating simulated data since running
lattice cluster simulations can be very expensive.
