Any molecule that can dissolve in polar liquids, dissociate into ions,
and carry an electrical current is an *electrolyte*. Molecules that
dissociate completely are called strong electrolytes, and those that
dissociate only partly are called weak electrolytes. Such ions can
regulate the chemical and physical equilibrium of other charged objects.
For example, DNA is a molecular chain of negative phosphate charges.
Because its charges repel each other, DNA is relatively expanded in
water. When $NaCl$ is added to an aqueous solution of DNA, the salt
dissociates into positive ions ($Na^+$) and negative ions ($Cl^-$). The
positive ions seek the DNA's negative charges, surrounding and shielding
them. This shielding weakens the intra-DNA charge repulsion, causing the
DNA to become more compact. Two biological cells each having a net
negative surface charge will also repel each other.

In this chapter we explore how ions shield charged objects. We start by
a review of electrostatics where we derive the expression for the
electrostatic energy of a charged sphere and cylinder. This expression
will provide the starting point for the analysis of more complex
situations, such as *electrostatic screening* due to the large
concentration of ions close to a surface with opposite charge.

## Electrostatic potential

Electrostatic interactions in an aqueous environment dramatically
influence the thermodynamic behavior. Polyelectrolytes (charged
polymers) are soluble in water, in contrast to most hydrocarbon-based
polymers. Most biopolymers are polyelectrolytes, and in many instances,
their biological function hinges on the role of electrostatic
interactions (Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig1"\}).

The force on a point particle with charge q in an electric field
$\vec\{E\}$ is given by $\vec\{f\} = q\vec\{E\}$. The potential energy can
then be written as $q\Psi$, where $\Psi$ is defined to be the
electrostatic potential, giving $\vec\{E\}=-\nabla \Psi$.

The electric field satisfies *Gauss' law*, which is written as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
\int_S \vec\{E\}\cdot \vec\{n\} dA = \frac\{4\pi\}\{\varepsilon\}\int_V \rho dV
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the medium (for
example, $\varepsilon = 7.083\times 10^\{-10\} C^2N^\{-1\}m^\{-2\}$, for water
at room temperature), and $\rho$ is the local charge density.

We apply the *divergence theorem* to this to arrive at:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
\int_V \vec\{\nabla\}\cdot \vec\{E\}dV = \frac\{4\pi\}\{\varepsilon\}\int_V \rho dV
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the electrostatic potential $\Psi$ is governed by Poisson's
align: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq3\}
\nabla^2\Psi = -\frac\{4\pi\rho(\vec\{r\})\}\{\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Electrostatic potential around a charged sphere

Consider a sphere with a radius a and total charge $q$. Due to symmetry,
the electrostatic potential around the sphere is radial, *ı.e.*
$\Psi = \Psi(r)$. Poisson's equation outside of the sphere is written
as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq4\}
\frac\{1\}\{r^2\}\frac\{d\}\{dr\}r^2\frac\{d\Psi\}\{dr\} = 0 \rightarrow \Psi = \frac\{A_1\}\{r\} + A_2
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constant of integration (to be determined).

Assume as $r\rightarrow \infty$, $\Psi\rightarrow 0$; thus, $A_2 = 0$.

The electric field in the radial direction is
$\hat\{e\}_r\cdot \vec\{E\} = \frac\{A1\}\{r_2\}$, and, using Gauss' law, we can
write: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
\frac\{A_1\}\{a^2\}4\pi a^2 = \frac\{4\pi q\}\{\varepsilon\} \rightarrow A_1 = \frac\{q\}\{\varepsilon\} \rightarrow \Psi = \frac\{q\}\{\varepsilon\}\frac\{1\}\{r\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

This potential is valid outside the radius $a$ ($r > a$). For a point
particle ($a\rightarrow 0$), this is valid throughout space.

The electrostatic potential provides the necessary information to find
the energy. The energy of interaction between two ions with charge $e$
(charge of an electron) separated by a distance $r$ is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
E_\{coulomb\} = \frac\{e^2\}\{\varepsilon\}\frac\{1\}\{r\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the medium (for
example, $\varepsilon = 7.083 \times 10^\{-10\}C^2N^\{-1\}m^\{-2\}$ for water
at room temperature) and the electron charge
$e = 1.6022\times 10^\{-19\}C$.

Define the Bjerrum length: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
l_B = \frac\{e^2\}\{k_BT\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

which gives the distance that two electrons are separated when their
energy is equal to $k_BT$ ($l_B = 7\AA$ for water at room temperature).

The energy of interaction for two monovalent ions in a dielectric medium
is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
E_\{coulomb\}= k_BT\frac\{l_B\}\{r\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## *Electrostatic potential around a charged cylinder* \{#electrostatic-potential-around-a-charged-cylinder .unnumbered\}

Consider a negatively charged cylinder of radius $a$ with a surface
charge such that the average distance between the surface charges is
$b$. The electrostatic potential in an uncharged medium ($\rho = 0$) is
given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
\nabla^2\Psi = \frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\}r\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\}\Psi  = 0 \rightarrow \Psi = A_1\log r + A_2
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we express the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates and assume
$\Psi = \Psi(r)$ only.

We find the boundary condition on the cylinder surface using Gauss' law
Using the divergence theorem, we write: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
\int_S \vec\{E\}\cdot \vec\{n\}dA = \frac\{4\pi\}\{\varepsilon\}\int_V \rho dV
\end\{aligned\}$$

This gives the boundary condition on the cylinder surface:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq11\}
\left( \hat\{e\}_r \cdot\vec\{E\} \right) 2\pi ab=-\frac\{4\pi e\}\{\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

This boundary condition on the cylinder surface is rewritten as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq12\}
\frac\{\partial \Psi\}\{\partial r\}\bigg|_\{r=a\} = \frac\{2e\}\{ab\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

giving $A_1=\frac\{2e\}\{b\varepsilon\}$.

For simplicity, we set $\Psi\rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow a$, fixing
$A_2 = -A_1 \log a$. This gives the solution for the electrostatic
potential. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq13\}
\Psi(r) = \frac\{2k_BTq\}\{e\}\log\left(r/a\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $q = \l_B/b$ and $l_B = e^2/(k_BT\varepsilon)$.

Unlike the point charge, the electrostatic potential outside of a
charged cylinder diverges logarithmically, which has dramatic
consequences on the counter-ion distribution.

## Screened electrostatic interaction in salt (Debye-Hückel theory)

When salt is added to the solution, the nature of the electrostatic
interactions is dramatically altered. A charged molecule or surface
attracts the mobile ions that have opposite charge, or *counter-ions*,
to the surface due to the strength of electrostatic interactions. At the
same time, the charged surface repels the mobile ions of the same sign,
called *co-ions*. For example a polyanion (negative polyelectrolyte) has
a flurry of positively charged counter-ions swarming around the polymer
(Fig [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}). The
interactions between charges are dramatically reduced due to the
*screening* of the electostatic interactions
(Fig [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3"\}).

Consider the interaction between two isolated ions in a monovalentsalt
solution with concentration $n_s$ (for example, $NaCl$ that dissociates
into $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions). The electrostatic potential $\Psi$ around
the tagged ion is governed by the Poisson's equation. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq14\}
\nabla^2\Psi = -\frac\{4\pi\rho(\vec\{r\})\}\{\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\rho$ is the local charge density in the solution.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/electrolytes/fig3.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

The energy of an ion with charge $q = ze$ (*e.g.* $q=-e$ for $Cl^-$)
located at $\vec\{r\}$ in the electrostatic potential $\Psi$ is given by
$E_\Psi = ze\Psi(\vec\{r\})$. As a charged colloidal particle is immersed
on the electrolyte solution, a gradient concentration of co-ions and
conter-ions is developed from the surface. Assume the local
concentration of counter-ions is given by a simple Boltzmann weight of
the ions in the electrostatic potential $\Psi$. Thus, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq15\}
\rho (\vec\{r\}) = n_s e \left[ \exp\left(-\frac\{e\Psi(\vec\{r\})\}\{k_BT\}\right) -\exp\left(+\frac\{e\Psi(\vec\{r\})\}\{k_BT\}\right)\right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where the left term is due to local concentration of $Na^+$, and the
right is due to $Cl^-$, and the position coordinate $\vec\{r\} = 0$ at the
surface of the charged colloidal particle
(Fig. [\[Poisson-Boltzmann\]](#Poisson-Boltzmann)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Poisson-Boltzmann"\})

::: marginfigure
[]\{#Poisson-Boltzmann label="Poisson-Boltzmann"\}
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/electrolytes/Poisson-Boltzmann.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Therefore, the electrostatic potential is governed by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq16\}
\nabla^2\Psi = \frac\{8\pi n_s e\}\{\varepsilon\}\sinh\left(\frac\{e\Psi\}\{k_BT\} \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This nonlinear equation does not
have a simple, closed-form solution. Implicit in this theory is the
neglect of local concentration fluctuations, akin to a mean-field
approximation.

For sufficiently large lengths where $\Psi \rightarrow 0$, we can expand
to lowest order. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq17\}
\nabla^2\Psi = \frac\{8\pi n_s e^2\}\{\varepsilon k_B T\}\Psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

We define the Debye length (Fig [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig4"\}): $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq18\}
l_D = \sqrt\{\frac\{\varepsilon k_BT\}\{8\pi e^2n_s\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

and assume that $\Psi = \Psi(r)$ only.

We now have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq19\}
\frac\{1\}\{r^2\}\frac\{\partial \}\{\partial r^2\}r^2\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\}\Psi = \frac\{1\}\{l_D^2\}\Psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

In the limit of large length separation $r$ and dilute solution of
counter-ions, we can write the electrostatic energy between two ions in
a salt solution as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq20\}
E_\{DH\} = \frac\{e^2\}\{4\pi \varepsilon\}\frac\{e^\{-r/l_D\}\}\{r\} = k_BTl_B \frac\{e^\{-r/l_D\}\}\{r\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

This is the Debye-Hückel theory of charge screening. The Debye-Hückel
theory adds a simple correction to the bare electrostatic potential to
account for counter-ion correlations.

:::

In the absence of salt, the electrostatic interaction energy is
extremely long range, scaling as $E_\{coulomb\} \sim 1/r$. Salt screening
leads to a short-range electrostatic interaction energy that decays
exponentially with distance of separation.

## Charge behavior at short range (Manning condensation)

Neglecting the nonlinear terms in the Poisson-Boltzmann equation leads
to a qualitatively incorrect behavior for distances very close to a
charged object, *e.g.* the surface of a polyelectrolyte. For a dilute
solution, the average distance between counter-ions is
$r_0 \sim n^\{-1/3\}_s$. At $r < r_0$, the mean-field approximation breaks
down, and we must address the interactions explicitly.

Consider the polyelectrolyte chain to be a charged cylinder with radius
a (Fig. [\[fig5\]](#fig5)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig5"\}), which
we assume to be very small ($a\rightarrow 0$ in our analysis). The
charged cylinder has negative charges smeared over its surface such that
the average distance between negative charges is $\eta$. We want to find
the behavior of an isolated ion interacting with the cylinder at
distances less than the average inter-ion spacing $r_0$.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/electrolytes/fig5.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Earlier in this chapter, we found the electrostatic potential around a
negatively charged cylinder in a dielectric medium to be:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
\Psi(r) = \frac\{2k_BTq\}\{e\}\log\left(r/a\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $q = l_B/\eta$. The electrostatic energy between the cylinder and
a positively charged monovalent ion is given by $E_\{cyl\}(r) = e\Psi(r)$.

The partition function for an isolated ion interacting with the charged
cylinder within the distance r0 for small cylinder radius
($a \rightarrow 0$) scales as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq22\}
Q&\sim \int_0^\{r_0\}  r \exp\left( -\frac\{E_\{cyl\}(r)\}\{k_BT\} \right) dr\\
&\sim \int_0^\{r_0\}r\exp(-2q\log(r)) dr\\
&\sim\int_0^\{r_0\}r^\{1-2q\}dr \\
&\sim \frac\{1\}\{2-2q\}r^\{2-2q\}\bigg|_0^\{r_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The partition function diverges if q \> 1.

To reconcile the divergence of the free energy, the mobile ions condense
on the cylinder surface to neutralize the surface charges such that
effectively $q_\{eff\} = l_B/\eta_\{eff\} = 1$. At short length scales,
Manning condensation leads to a reduced surface charge. At long length
scales, the interaction is a screened electrostatic coulomb potential.
