One of the most useful applications of type theory is to track units and
dimensional analysis for physical systems. In this chapter, we will
explain how to use a type system to track units and perform dimensional
analysis with Physika.

We start by considering mass. We say that mass $m$ is in kilograms by
assigning it the type

    m: kg

Here `kg` is a modified version of type $\mathbb\{R\}^+$ with a modified
unit (the unit corresponds to one kilogram). Let's next consider length.
We say length `l` is denoted in meters by assigning type

    l: meter

Here `m` is a modified version of $\mathbb\{R\}^+$ with a modified unit
(the unit corresponds to one meter). Similarly, we say `t` is a time
interval measured in seconds by saying

    t: seconds

Units form a mathematical algebra. That is, the following quantities are
all units

    m * s, m / s, m / s^2, kg * m / s^2

Physika's type system allows us to track the units of expressions.

An alternative method for facilitating dimensional analysis is to have
units have more basic types

    l: [L]
    t: [T]
    m: [M]

Here we use `[L],[T], [M]` to denote the most basic types for distance,
time and mass rather than a specific instantiation such as meters,
seconds, or kilograms. This more abstract level of analysis can prove
useful when doing abstract analyses of systems.

An important concept that arises is that units can cancel. We can model
this by stating that for example

    a : meter / meter $\sim a$ : $\mathbb\{R\}$

That is, a quantity that is of type `meter/meter` is just a scalar
quantity. We can then proceed to write down types for common physical
quantities

    Area: [L]$^2$
    Speed: [L][T]$^\{-1\}$
    Acceleration: [L][T]$^\{-2\}$
    Force: [M][L][T]$^\{-2\}$
    Energy: [M][L]$^2$[T]$^\{-2\}$

This type of decomposition can be very useful when studying the behavior
of physical systems. For example, we can derive the types of physical
constants from this analysis. Consider Newton's gravitational equation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    F &= - \frac\{G m_1 m_2\}\{r^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can consider the types on both sides to obtain the
equation

    [M][L][T]$^\{-2\}$ = [G][M]$^2$[L]$^\{-2\}$

Solving, we obtain

    [G] = [M]$^\{-1\}$[L]$^3$[T]$^\{-2\}$

We can solve similarly for the types of other physical constants.

## Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem

Suppose that we have a physical equation given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(q_1,\dotsc,q_n) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Assume that the $q_i$ are physically independent variables and assume
there are $k$ units (mass, time, etc) in this equation. Then the
Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem states that there are $p = n - k$ dimensionless
terms $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \pi_i &= q_1^\{a_1\}\dotsc q_n^\{a_n\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where the $a_i$ are rational terms such that the
original equation can be restated as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    F(\pi_1,\dotsc,\pi_p) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Philosophically, the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem
demonstrates that the laws of physics are independent of particular
choices of units.
