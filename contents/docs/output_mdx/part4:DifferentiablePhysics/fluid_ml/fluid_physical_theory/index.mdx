We introduce a simple formulation of fluid dynamics as a physical
theory. This simple formulation will serve as a foundation for the more
sophisticated theories of fluid dynamics we will present in subsequent
chapters.

The state space of a fluid is given by the flow field of the fluid over
some specified geometric region $D \subseteq \mathbb\{R\}^3$. Formally,
this would be a vector field which we can define as type
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    D \to \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$

Notice here that we assume that the fluid is incompressible and has
constant density. In this basic model .

For this first simple model of fluid evolution, we will avoid dealing
with the complexities of turbulence or other effects and assume that we
are dealing with simple convective flow.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial t\} + c \nabla \cdot u &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

We assume conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in this system.

We assume that we have the ability to draw observations of the
underlying vector field $u$ subject to a noise model given by
$\mathcal\{N\}(b, \sigma)$ where $b$ is a bias term and $\sigma$ is a
noise term.

The model is parameterized by a set of initial conditions on the
geometry $$\begin\{aligned\}
    u_0: D \to \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ In the case of convective flow, this initial condition
is often called the initial wave. The parameter $c$ is the initial speed
of the wave.

We can convert this physical theory into a simple differentiable program

``` \{.python language="python"\}
class ConvectiveFluid(D $\subseteq$ $\mathbb\{R\}^3$, $u_0$: $D \to \mathbb\{R\}^3$)

  def simulate(t: $\mathbb\{R\}$):
    u : $D  \to \mathbb\{R\}^3$
    return solve($\partial$(u, t) + c $\nabla \cdot$(u) = 0, $u_0$, 0, t)
```

We can apply different methods to implement `solve` such as finite
differences, PINNs, neural operators and more. We will study certain
concrete implementations in the coming chapters.
