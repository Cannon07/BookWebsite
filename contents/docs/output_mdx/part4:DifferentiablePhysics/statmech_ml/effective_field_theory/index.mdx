We have seen in earlier chapters that an infinitely wide neural network
converges to a Gaussian process. This result is of considerable
theoretical value, but does not offer much practical guidance to the
theory of finite neural networks.

However, there is an interesting connection to field theory. A classical
free field theory is in fact a Gaussian process. There exist a rich
variety of theories used in classical physics to model and compute with
interactions on top of the free field theory. These same theoretical
methods can be used to add corrections from the infinite width Gaussian
process network to more practical finite width networks.
