In the previous chapter, we learned how to solve the Klein-Gordon
equation for simple free fields. Solving the Klein-Gordon equation for
more complex fields with potentials requires additional mathematical
infrastructure. In particular, we will make use of the Green's function.

## Defining the Green's Function

The Green's function for the Klein-Gordon equation is also commonly
called the propagator in quantum field theory. The Green's function is
defined as the solution to the following equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    -(\partial^2 + m^2)D(x) &= \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall that the Klein-Gordon equation is defined on Minkowski space,
where we define

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \partial^2 = \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_1^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_2^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_3^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$m \in \mathbb\{R\}$ is an arbitrary real number. Recall that the general
form of Green's functions is as distributions and not as functions so we
expect $D(x)$ to define a distribution and not a function. To solve the
equation above, we use the Fourier representation of the Dirac delta
function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \delta^\{(4)\}(x) = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$

As a first note, recall that $k,x  \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$ are elements of
Minkowski space. So the notation above is actually shorthand for

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    kx \equiv k_0 t - k_1 x_1 - k_2 x_2 - k_3 x_3
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall that the dirac delta $\delta^\{(4)\}(x)$ defines a functional and
is a distribution and not a function. So the integral on the right hand
side above should be read as defining a mapping

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    g(x) \mapsto \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$

To find a solution, as is often the case with differential equations, we
turn to exponential functions. Let's compute

$$\begin\{aligned\}
-(\partial^2 + m^2 ) e^\{ikx\} &= -\left (\frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_1^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_2^2\} - \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x_3^2\}  + m^2 \right ) e^\{i(k_0t - k_1x_1 - k_2x_2 - k_3x_3)\}  \\
&= -\left ((ik_0)^2e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_1)^2e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_2)^2 e^\{ikx\} - (-ik_3)^2 e^\{ikx\} + m^2 e^\{ikx\}\right ) \\
&= -((ik_0)^2 - (-ik_1)^2 - (-ik_2)^2  - (-ik_3)^2 +m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= -(-k_0^2 + k_1^2 + k_2^2  + k_3^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= -(-k^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\} \\
&= (k^2 - m^2)e^\{ikx\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, $e^\{ikx\}$ is an eigenfunction of the operator
$-(\partial^2 + m^2)$. We could then hypothesize that the Green's
function of the Klein-Gordon operator would be given by the following
\"function\".

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then, by applying the Klein-Gordon operator, we would
obtain, by differentiating through the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (-\partial^2 + m^2) \left [ \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2\} d^4 k \right ] &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{-(\partial^2 +m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2\} d^4 k \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2\} d^4 k  \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k \\
    &= \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This calculation works almost everywhere. The exception
is at those points where $k^2 = m^2$. Expanding out the equation, this
is the surface of points $$\begin\{aligned\}
    k_0^2 - k_1^2 - k_2^2 - k_3^3 = m^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ Such a surface is vanishingly small compared to the
entirety of $\mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$. We know that for point singularities, it
is sometimes possible to complete the function by taking a limit. The
limit completion technique used for this function is called the
$(i\varepsilon)$ prescription. The idea is to prevent the singularity on
the surface $k^2 = m^2$ by adding a small nonzero value, the
$i\varepsilon$. That is, we define the distribution $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2 + i\epsilon\} d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ How are we to interpret this expression? It's easiest to
concretely represent the expression as a mapping $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g(x) \mapsto \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon\} g(x) d^4 k
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us now apply the Klein-Gordon operator to this
distribution by differentiating through the integral sign and through
the limit $$\begin\{aligned\}
    &= (-\partial^2 + m^2) \left [ \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i \varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k\right ] \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(-\partial^2 + m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4 k \\
    &= \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2 - m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4 k \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ We claim that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k &= \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4k
\end\{aligned\}$$

It then follows that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} d^4 k = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} d^4 k = \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ holds as an equality of distributions.

We see in these manipulations, the $g(x)$ term is just carried around.
From now on, when performing manipulations with distributions, we will
often not show the \"test function\" $g(x)$ and the limit explicitly,
but will just perform manipulations directly. If you are confused about
how an operation is valid, write out the test function and limit in full
detail to convince yourself.

## Exercises

1.  For a given test function $g$, prove that $$\begin\{aligned\}
        \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2)e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} g(x) d^4k &= \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4k
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ State the assumptions about $g$ that you make to
    prove this statement.

2.  Prove that $$\begin\{aligned\}
        \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \lim_\{\varepsilon \to 0\} \int \frac\{(k^2-m^2) e^\{ikx\}\}\{k^2-m^2+i\varepsilon\} d^4 k = \frac\{1\}\{(2\pi)^4\} \int e^\{ikx\} g(x) d^4 k = \delta^\{(4)\}(x)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ holds as a limit in the topology of distributions.
