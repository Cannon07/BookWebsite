Computations in physics are often facilitated by using special classes
of functions that satisfy certain properties. While such functions will
be intimately familiar to physicists, they are often more mathematically
obscure to scientists from other disciplines. In this section, we will
introduce some families of useful functions that we will have occasion
to use later in the book.

## Spherical Harmonics

Spherical harmonics form an orthogonal basis set of functions on the
surface of the sphere. For this reason, spherical harmonics prove very
useful in physics for decomposing radial functions to do Fourier
analysis.

To define spherical harmonics, we start by first defining the associated
Legendre polynomials. These polynomials are the solutions to the general
Legendre equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
(1 - x^2)\frac\{d^2\}\{dx^2\}P^m_\{\ell\}(x) - 2x\frac\{d\}\{dx\}P^m_\{\ell\}(x) + \left [\ell(\ell + 1) - \frac\{m^2\}\{1-x^2\} \right] P^m_\{\ell\}(x) = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here the indices $m, \ell$ are both integers which are referred to
respectively as the degree and order of the polynomial. In the special
case the $m$ is $0$, the Legendre polynomials are given by Rodrigues'
formula

$$\begin\{aligned\}
P_\{\ell\}(x) = \frac\{1\}\{2^\{\ell\}\ell!\}\frac\{d^\{\ell\}\}\{dx^\{\ell\}\} [(x^2 - 1)^\{\ell\}]
\end\{aligned\}$$

The spherical harmonics $Y^m_\{\ell\}(\theta, \varphi)$ are defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Y^m_\{\ell\}(\theta, \varphi) &= N e^\{im \varphi\} P^m_\{\ell\}(\cos \theta)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $N$ is a normalization constant to satisfy the orthonormality
constraint.

positive, and yellow portions represent where it is negative. The
distance of the surface from the origin indicates the absolute value of
$Y_\{\ell \}^\{m\}(\theta ,\varphi)$ in angular direction $(\theta,\varphi)$

Alternatively, the spherical harmonics can be viewed as the
eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator $\nabla^2$. They satisfy the
equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
r^2 Y^m_\{\ell\}(\theta, \varphi) &= -\ell (\ell + 1) Y^m_\{\ell\}(\theta, \varphi)
\end\{aligned\}$$

An arbitrary solution to Laplace's equation, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 f &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ can then be written by the Fourier decomposition
$$\begin\{aligned\}
f(r, \theta, \varphi) &= \sum_\{\ell = 0\}^\infty \sum_\{m = -\ell\}^\{\ell\} f^m_\ell r^\ell Y^m_\{\ell\}(\theta, \varphi)
\end\{aligned\}$$

In fact, any square integrable function $f: S^2 \to \mathbb\{C\}$ on the
sphere can be decomposed in this fashion.

The product of two spherical harmonics can be decomposed as a sum of
spherical harmonics using the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients
$C^\{LM\}_\{\ell_1 m_1 \ell_2 m_2\}$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
Y^\{m_1\}_\{\ell_1\} Y^\{m_2\}_\{\ell_2\} &= \sum_\{L, M\} C^\{L0\}_\{\ell_1 0 \ell_2 0\} C^\{LM\}_\{\ell_1 m_1 \ell_2 m_2\} Y^M_\{L\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The definition we have given above defines spherical harmonics as
specific functions. There are a number of variants of the definition
that can yield slightly different functions. For this reason, it is
useful to talk of the space $H_\ell$ of all spherical harmonics of
degree $\ell$. This space proves useful since it allow for a group
representation of $SO(3)$, the symmetry group of three dimensional
rotation matrices. Suppose that $\rho$ is a rotation matrix and
$\psi \in H_\ell$ is a spherical harmonic. Then $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho \cdot \psi &= \psi \circ \rho^\{-1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ defines another spherical harmonic.

## Gamma Function

The Gamma function $\Gamma$ provides a generalization of the factorial
operation to the complex numbers. On the integers, the Gamma function
has values

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Gamma(n) &= (n-1)!
\end\{aligned\}$$

On the positive real numbers, the Gamma function can be defined by the
integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
\Gamma(r) &= \int_0^\infty t^\{r-1\}e^\{-t\} dt
\end\{aligned\}$$ This definition can be extended to the complex plane
(except 0 and the negative integers) by analytic continuation. The plot
below shows $\Gamma$ along the full real axis

![Plot of the values of the Gamma function along the real axis. Note
that the Gamma function has poles at the negative
integers.](figures/Mathematical Foundations/special_functions/gamma_function.png)\{#fig:my_label\}

## Bessel Functions

The Bessel functions are the solutions to Bessel's differential equation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
x^2 \frac\{dy^2\}\{dx^2\} + x \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} + (x^2 - \alpha^2) y &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

They arise in the solution of Laplace's equation and Schrodinger's
equation in cylindrical coordinates. Bessel functions can be thought of
as a generalization of the sine functions. Since the Bessel functions
arise as the solutions to a second order differential equation, there
are two linearly independent familes of solutions which are typically
called Bessel functions of the first type (denote $J_\alpha$) and Bessel
functions of the second type (denoted $Y_\alpha$)

## Airy Functions

The Airy functions are given by the solutions to the differential
equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{d^2 y\}\{dx^2\} - xy &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Airy functions are useful to describe the physics of rainbows and to
solve Schrodinger's equation in triangular potential wells (which arise
in semiconductor physics). Airy functions also come in two kinds,
typically denoted $\mathrm\{Ai\}(x)$ and $\mathrm\{Bi\}(x)$.
