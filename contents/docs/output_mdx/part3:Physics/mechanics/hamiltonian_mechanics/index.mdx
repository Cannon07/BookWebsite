Like the Lagrangian formulation, the Hamiltonian formulation of
classical mechanics describes the the equations of motion, using a
different quantity, $H$, called the Hamiltonian, which is generally
defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies.

## Basic Formulation

Let $q$ be the position and $p$ the momentum. The general form of the
Hamiltonian for a system is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{hamiltonian\}
\mathcal\{H\} &= T+V\\
&= \frac\{p^2\}\{2m\} + V(q,t)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $T$ is the kinetic energy, and $V$ is the potential energy with
$\dot\{q\}$ is the velocity. The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator in
one dimension would hence be

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{soln2c\}
\mathcal\{H\} &= \frac\{1\}\{2\}mv^2 + \frac\{1\}\{2\}kx^2 
\end\{aligned\}$$

From these two simple examples we can infer some key conclusions.
Classical mechanics predicts particle motion to be deterministic, i.e.
the conditions of a particle at a given time will chart out its future
trajectory. The Lagrangian formulation teaches us that a particle
traverses along a path where action $S$ is an extremum. A particle that
is free from the influence of any external potential (and thus forces)
will maintain a constant velocity, as proposed by Newton's first law of
motion. Finally, the motion of a particle in a stationary or time
independent potential will be governed by the constraint of maintaining
constant total energy $H = T + V$, as described by the Hamiltonian
formulation.

## A Mathematical Formulation

Suppose that we have a set of coordinates $(p, q)$ where
$p=(p_1,\dotsc,p_N)$ is a set of generalized position variables and
$q = (q_1, \dotsc, q_N)$ is a set of generalized momentum variables.
Recall that generalized position and momentum coordinates have to
satisfy a set of constraints given by Poisson brackets

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{q_i, q_j\} &= 0 \\
    \{p_, p_j\} &= 0 \\
    \{q_i, p_j\} &= \delta_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall here that the Poisson bracket is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{f, g\} &= \sum_i \left ( \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial q_i\} \frac\{\partial g\}\{\partial p_i\} - \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial p_i\} \frac\{\partial g\}\{\partial q_i\} \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Hamiltonian $\mathcal\{H\}$ is a function such that

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{dq\}\{dt\} &= \frac\{\partial \mathcal\{H\}\}\{d p\} \\
    \frac\{dp\}\{dt\} &= -\frac\{\partial \mathcal\{H\}\}\{d q\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ These equations tell us that the system evolves in the
direction $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \Delta S &= (\frac\{dq\}\{dt\}, \frac\{dp\}\{dt\}) \\ 
    &= \left (\frac\{\partial \mathcal\{H\}\}\{d p\}, -\frac\{\partial \mathcal\{H\}\}\{d q\}\right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

This form of the time update rules can prove very effective for modeling
some classes of physical systems.

## A Spherical Pendulum

A spherical pendulum features an object with mass $m$ that is moving on
the surface of a sphere while suspended from a point. The Lagrangian for
this system is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
L &= T - V \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{2\}ml^2(\dot\{\theta\}^2 + \sin^2 \theta \dot\{\phi\}^2) - (-mgl\cos \theta)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The canonical coordinates here are $\theta, \phi$, the angles on the
sphere. The Hamiltonian is then given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
H &= \frac\{dL\}\{d \dot\{\theta\}\} \dot\{\theta\} + \frac\{dL\}\{d\dot\{\phi\}\} \dot\{\phi\} - L
\end\{aligned\}$$
