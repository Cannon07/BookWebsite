In
[\[chap:electrostatics\]](#chap:electrostatics)\{reference-type="ref+label"
reference="chap:electrostatics"\}, we learned about the behavior of
systems of point charges. In the real world, it's more common to deal
with flowing electric charges or electric currents. In this chapter we
introduce the mathematical and computational models used to study
electric current. We also introduce the notion of the magnetic field, a
powerful abstraction useful for the study of complex electric systems.
Magnetic fields are associated with electric currents much as electric
fields are associated with static electrical charges.

## Electric Current

Let's define electric current more formally. We say that the electric
current is the rate of flow of electric charge past a point or a region.
The mathematical symbols used to define electrical current are usually
either $I$ or $J$. Suppose that charge $Q$ flows through a given region
of space in time $t$. We can then define $$\begin\{aligned\}
    I = \frac\{Q\}\{t\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

As the time $t$ goes to $0$, we can replace this definition with a
suitable limit $$\begin\{aligned\}
    I = \frac\{dQ\}\{dt\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can define types for these quantities

    Q : Ampere, t: sec, I: Ampere/sec

Recall that `Ampere` is the same type as $\mathbb\{R\}$ and `sec` is the
same type as $\mathbb\{R\}^+$. Since $Q \in \mathbb\{R\}$ is a real valued
quantity, and $t \in \mathbb\{R\}^+$ is a nonnegative quantity, we can say
that $I \in \mathbb\{R\}$ is also a real valued quantity.

## Lorentz Force Law

Empirically, Coulomb's law isn't a complete description of the physics
moving electrical particles since it ignores magnetism. Consequently, we
introduce a new law, the *Lorentz force law*. Let $\vec\{E\}(t)$ be the
electric field and let $\vec\{B\}(t)$ be the magnetic field. A particle
with charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec\{v\}$ experiences a force given
by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{F\} = q(E + v \times B)
    \label\{lorentz:force\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

We've introduced a new concept in this definition, that of the magnetic
field $\vec\{B\}$. What is the magnetic field? To give a more
sophisticated derivation of the magnetic field, we will need to wait
until the section on special relativity. For now, it's not wrong to view
Equation [\[lorentz:force\]](#lorentz:force)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="lorentz:force"\} as *defining* the magnetic field. That is,
the magnetic field can be viewed as an empirical correction term that
fixes Coulomb's law to work for electrodynamical systems. The magnetic
field is a field much like the classical field and has a similar type

    B: $\mathbb\{R\}^3 \to T\mathbb\{R\}^3$

### A charged particle in a magnetic field

In this simple example, we consider a charged particle moving in a
magnetic field as illustrated in
Figure [1.1](#fig:charged_particle_magnetic_field)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:charged_particle_magnetic_field"\}.

Let's introduce a coordinate basis of orthonormal vectors for this
example. We are working in $\mathbb\{R\}^3$ and we have vectors
$\hat\{i\}, \hat\{j\}, \hat\{k\}$. We choose this basis such that
$\hat\{i\} \times \hat\{j\} = \hat\{k\}$. Let's say that the
$\vec\{v_0\} = \hat\{i\}$ and $\vec\{B\} = \hat\{j\}$ everyone in
$\mathbb\{R\}^3$. The states of the system are $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{S\} = \mathbb\{R\}^3 \times \mathbb\{R\}^3 \times \mathbb\{R\}^3  
\end\{aligned\}$$ Each state consists of a tuple
$(\vec\{x\}, \vec\{v\}, \vec\{a\})$ of position, velocity, and acceleration
for the charged particle. We define force $F$ by $$\begin\{aligned\}
F(x) = q(\vec\{v\} \times \vec\{B\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using the known value of $\vec\{v_0\}$, we can compute $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{F_0\} &= q (\vec\{v_0\} \times \vec\{B\}) \\
&= q \|\vec\{v_0\}\| \|\vec\{B\}\|(\hat\{i\} \times \hat\{j\}) \\
&= q\|\vec\{v_0\}\| \|\vec\{B\}\|\hat\{k\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

For the domain of applicability, we limit the velocity to
non-relativistic speeds $\|\vec\{v\}\| < C$.

The parameters of the system are $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\} = \{q, \vec\{B\}, \vec\{v_0\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $q$ is the charge of the particle, $\vec\{B\}$ is
the constant magnetic field, and $\vec\{v_0\}$ is the initial velocity.
The hyperparameters are given by $\mathcal\{H\} = \{C\}$.

Note that the initial force $\vec\{F_0\}$ we computed points perpendicular
to the motion of the particle. This is exactly the force needed to
induce circular motion. Note that this motion will ensure that the
charged particle is always perpendicular to the magnetic field so this
circle will close in on itself.

We can solve for the radius of the circle using the definition of
centripetal force. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    q\|\vec\{v_0\}\|\|\vec\{B\}\| &= \frac\{m\|v_0\|^2\}\{R\} \\
    R &= \frac\{m\|v_0\|\}\{q\|\vec\{B\}\|\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Ampère's Law

Where does the magnetic field come from? The rough idea is that magnetic
fields are induced by movement of electric charge. Let's introduce one
more law to formalize this, *Ampère's Law*. This law states that the
line integral of the magnetic field $\vec\{B\}$ around a close path is a
multiple of the current enclosed by the path.
$$\oint_C \vec\{B\} \dot d\vec\{s\} = \mu_0 I_\{\textrm\{encl\}\}$$
