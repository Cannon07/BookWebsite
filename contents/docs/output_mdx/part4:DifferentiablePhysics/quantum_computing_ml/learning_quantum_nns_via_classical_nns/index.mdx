Combining quantum computing with machine learning methods holds out the
promise of powerful hybrid [@verdon2019learning]. The core idea is to
construct a parameterized quantum circuit $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Y = Q_\{\theta\}(X)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Parameters $\theta$ are optimized with respect to a loss
function $L$. Another challenge in this space is designing methods to
initialize parameters with initial guesses $\theta_0$. The function we
seek to optimize is the expectation value of a Hamiltonian $\hat\{H\}$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(\theta) &= \langle H \rangle_\theta \\
    &=\langle \psi_\theta | \hat\{H\} | \psi_\theta \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ This function is referred to as the cost function or the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian and must be estimated through many
runs of the underlying quantum circuit. The classical optimization task
is to identify $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \theta^* &= \arg\min_\{\theta\} f(\theta)
\end\{aligned\}$$

In the case that the classical optimization algorithm is given by an
RNN, we can write

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    h_\{t+1\}, \theta_\{t+1\} &= \textrm\{RNN\}_\{\varphi\}(h_t, \theta_t, y_t)
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Combining with Machine Learning Framework Libraries

As we have seen earlier in the book, one of the most powerful drivers
for the growth of differentiable programming techniques has been the
advent of powerful automatic differentiation libraries like TensorFlow
and PyTorch. One advantage of a combined framework for quantum computing
and machine learning is the possibility of constructing a powerful
automatic framework for hybrid quantum-classical systems. Frameworks
like TensorFlow Quantum [@verdon2019learning] attempt to cross this
boundary and have found early uses for quantum control and other use
cases.
