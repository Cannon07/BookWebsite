Having reviewed classical thermodynamics, we now venture into the
concept of thermodynamic stability. We learned that a system reaches
equilibrium when any small variation of the thermodynamic potential is
zero, *i.e.* $\delta U = 0$ for a closed isolated system. However, the
second law imposes an additional condition: *a closed isolated system is
in equilibrium when the entropy has reached its global maximum*. This is
directly related with the concept of thermodynamic stability and
fluctuations, meaning that even when microscopically the system is under
constant change, it will remain stable to small variation from
equilibrium. Using *Maxwell Relations*, we will derive explicit
expressions to analyze the stability of a system. In the last part of
this module, we will use these expression to derive the conditions for
phase equilibrium.

## Maxwell Relations

We learned that macroscopic system can be studied under the perspective
of different ensembles, each one having a thermodynamic potential, and
three control variables. Thus, a closed isolated system is represented
by the control variables $U,V,N$ and the thermodynamic potential $S$, or
similarly, with the control variables $S,V,N$, and the thermodynamic
potential $U$. Also, from the statement that the control variables are
extensive, we derived an explicit expression for internal energy through
the *Euler Equation*.

The functional form of a closed isolated system, together with the use
of *Legendre Transformations*, allow us to derive a number of new
ensembles and their respective thermodynamic potentials. The following
list considers the most used thermodynamic potentials, and their
differential forms:\
**Internal Energy: $U(S,V,N)$** $$\begin\{aligned\}
U = TS - pV + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{N\}_i \rightarrow dU = TdS - pdV + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{dN\}_i \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ **Enthalpy: $H(S,p,N)$** $$\begin\{aligned\}
H = TS  + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{N\}_i \rightarrow dH = TdS + Vdp + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{dN\}_i \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ **Helmholtz Free Energy**: $F(T,V,N)$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
F = -pV + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{N\}_i \rightarrow dF = -SdT - pdV    + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{dN\}_i \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ **Gibbs Free Energy**: $G(T,p,N)$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
G = \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{N\}_i \rightarrow dG = -SdT + Vdp  + \sum^r_\{i=1\}\mu_i\{dN\}_i \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ **Landau Potential**: $\Phi(T,V,\mu)$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
\Phi = -pV \rightarrow d\Phi = -SdT - pdV   - \sum^r_\{i=1\}\{N\}_id\mu_i \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

The second-order partial derivatives with respect to these potentials do
not depend on the order that you perform the derivative (state
variables). For example, we have
$\left(\frac\{\partial^2 U\}\{\partial V \partial S\}\right) = \left(\frac\{\partial^2 U\}\{\partial S \partial V\}\right)$,
from where we find:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{T-prelation\}
\{\left(\frac\{\partial T\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{S,N\} =  
-\{\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial S\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Such second-derivative equalities are called Maxwell relations. The
Maxwell relations involving $T$, $S$, $p$ and $V$ are:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\left(\frac\{\partial T\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{S,N\} =  
-\{\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{V,N\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} \{\left(\frac\{\partial T\}\{\partial p\}\right)\}_\{S,N\} =  
\{\left(\frac\{\partial V\}\{\partial S\}\right)\}_\{p,N\} \notag \\
\{\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\} =  
\{\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial T\}\right)\}_\{V,N\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} \{\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial p\}\right)\}_\{T,N\} =  
-\{\left(\frac\{\partial V\}\{\partial T\}\right)\}_\{p,N\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

In addition to these Maxwell relations, there exist partial derivatives
involving the chemical potential of the *i*th species $\mu_i$. For
example, the Maxwell relation:

$$\{\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial N_i\}\right)\}_\{T,V,N_\{j\neq i\}\} =  
-\{\left(\frac\{\partial \mu_i\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\}$$

is derived from the second derivative of the Helmholtz free energy
$\left(\frac\{\partial^2 F\}\{\partial N_i \partial V\}\right) = \left(\frac\{\partial^2 F\}\{\partial V \partial N_i\}\right)$.

The Maxwell relations are useful for relating difficult to find
thermodynamic quantities to quantities that are more easily determined.
In particular, changes in entropy are difficult to find, so it's easier
to relate this to a change in $p$ or $V$ with respect to $T$.

## Thermodynamic Stability

We discussed the conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed,
isolated system with subsystems 1 and 2. Specifically, we found the
following criterion for equilibrium:

-   Thermal equilibrium occurs when $T^\{(1)\} = T^\{(2)\}$.

-   Mechanical equilibrium occurs when $p^\{(1)\} = p^\{(2)\}$.

-   Chemical equilibrium occurs when $\mu_i^\{(1)\} = \mu_i^\{(2)\}$, for
    all species $i=1,2...,r$.

These criterion were derived by finding conditions where
$(\delta S)_\{U,V,N\} = 0$ (first variation of the entropy).

:::

According to the second law of thermodynamics, the equilibrium condition
means also that the entropy has reached a maximum. However, the maximum
entropy condition requires that the curvature is negative, *i.e.* the
second variation of the entropy satisfies $(\delta^2 S)_\{U,V,N\} < 0$.
Thus, conditions where $(\delta^2 S)_\{U,V,N\} = 0$, mark the point where
the equilibrium point is unstable (limit of stability).

Consider a closed, isolated system that is at equilibrium. Within the
system are two subsystems that are separated by a rigid, impenetrable
barrier that conducts heat
(Fig. [\[fig:isolatedsystem\]](#fig:isolatedsystem)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:isolatedsystem"\}). A small fluctuation in heat across the
boundary causes a small perturbation in the internal energy of the
subsystems ($\delta U^\{(1)\} = -\delta U^\{(2)\}$). Since the boundary is
rigid and impenetrable, the volumes and particle numbers remain fixed
(*i.e.*
$\delta V^\{(1)\} = \delta V^\{(2)\}=\delta N^\{(1)\} = \delta N^\{(2)\}=0$).
However, there will be a perturbation to the entropy of the system, from
where we can determine whether the system remains stable.

Since the entropy is an extensive quantity ($S^\{(1)\}+S^\{(2)\} = S)$, we
can express a change in the entropy of the system be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
 \label\{deltaS\}
\Delta S &= S^\{(1)\} \left( U^\{(1)\}+\delta U^\{(1)\},V^\{(1)\},N^\{(1)\}\right) +S^\{(2)\} \left( U^\{(2)\}+\delta U^\{(2)\},V^\{(2)\},N^\{(2)\}\right) 
\notag\\  
& \hspace\{0.5cm\} -S^\{(1)\} \left( U^\{(1)\},V^\{(1)\},N^\{(1)\}\right) -S^\{(2)\} \left( U^\{(2)\},V^\{(2)\},N^\{(2)\}\right) 
\notag\\
&=\left[\{\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}^\{(1)\}-\{\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}^\{(2)\}\right]\delta U^\{(1)\} 
\notag\\  
& \hspace\{0.5cm\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\left[\{\left(\frac\{\partial^2 S\}\{\partial^2 U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}^\{(1)\}+\{\left(\frac\{\partial^2 S\}\{\partial^2 U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}^\{(2)\}\right]\{\left(\delta U^\{(1)\}\right)\}^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

up to quadratic order in the perturbation $\delta U^\{(1)\}$.

The linear-order term is the first variation of the entropy
$\left(\partial S\right)_\{U,V,N\}$ , and the quadratic-order term is the
second variation $\left(\partial^2 S\right)_\{U,V,N\}$. Since we begin at
equilibrium, $T^\{(1)\}=T^\{(2)\}=T$, and noting that
$\{\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\}=\frac\{1\}\{T\}$, the
first term at the right of
Eq. [\[deltaS\]](#deltaS)\{reference-type="ref" reference="deltaS"\}. is
zero. For the second term, we use the thermodynamic relations:

$$\{\left(\frac\{\partial^2 S\}\{\partial^2 U\}\right)\}_\{V,N\} = \left(\frac\{\delta (1/T)\}\{\delta U\}\right)_\{V,N\} = -\frac\{1\}\{T^2C_v\}$$

where $C_v$ is the heat capacity
$C_v=\left(\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial T\}\right)_\{V,N\}=T\left(\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial T\}\right)_\{V,N\}$

Therefore, we have that change in entropy associated with the
spontaneous perturbation $\delta U^\{(1)\}$ is:

$$\Delta S = -\frac\{1\}\{2T^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{C_v^\{(1)\}\}+\frac\{1\}\{C_v^\{(2)\}\}\right)\left(\delta U^\{(1)\}\right)^2$$

For the system to remain stable, we must have a negative change in
entropy \[$\Delta S <0$ or $\left(\delta^2 S\right)_\{U,V,N\}<0$\]. This
implies that: $$\label\{Eq6\}
\frac\{1\}\{T^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{C_v^\{(1)\}\}+\frac\{1\}\{C_v^\{(2)\}\}\right)>0$$

The subsystem sizes are arbitrary, thus to ensure stability, both
contributions must independently satisfy this inequality. This leaves
the stability criteria for a thermodynamic system to remain stable with
respect to a spontaneous energy fluctuation:

$$\label\{Eq7\}
\frac\{1\}\{T^2C_v\}>0 \hspace\{1.0cm\} \text\{or\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} C_v>0$$

Now consider a closed, isothermal system at equilibrium, whose two
subsystems are separated by a sliding, impenetrable barrier
(Fig. [\[fig:2\]](#fig:2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:2"\}). A
small fluctuation in the boundary position causes a small perturbation
in the volume of the subsystems ($\delta V^\{(1)\} = -\delta V^\{(2)\}$).
Since the boundary is impenetrable, the particle numbers remain fixed
(*i.e.* $\delta N^\{(1)\} = \delta N^\{(2)\}=0$).

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig2.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

The closed, isothermal ensemble is governed by the Helmholtz free energy
$F=F(T,V,N)$. The response of the Helmholtz free energy to this
perturbation determines whether the system remains stable.

Following a similar line of reasoning as before, we write the
fluctuation in the free energy as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \label\{Eq8\}
\Delta F &=\left[\{\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\}^\{(1)\}-\{\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\}^\{(2)\}\right]\delta V^\{(1)\} 
\notag\\  
& \hspace\{0.5cm\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\left[\{\left(\frac\{\partial^2 F\}\{\partial^2 V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\}^\{(1)\}+\{\left(\frac\{\partial^2 F\}\{\partial^2 V\}\right)\}_\{T,N\}^\{(2)\}\right]\{\left(\delta V^\{(1)\}\right)\}^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

where first and second term on the right side correspond to the first
\[$\left(\delta F\right)_\{T,V,N\}$\] and second
\[$\left(\delta^2 F\right)_\{T,V,N\}$\] variations of the Helmholtz free
energy, respectively.

Since the system begins at equilibrium, the first variation is zero. The
second law of thermodynamics implies that the free energy is minimized
at equilibrium, thus the system is stable if $\Delta F>0$. Using the
thermodynamic relation
$\left(\frac\{\partial^2 F\}\{\partial^2 V\}\right)_\{T,N\} = -\left(\frac\{\delta p\}\{\delta V\}\right)_\{T,N\}$,
we get:

$$\label\{Eq9\}
-\left[\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial V\}\right)_\{T,N\}^\{(1)\}+\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial V\}\right)_\{T,N\}^\{(2)\}\right] >0$$

Therefore, we have
$\kappa_T=-\frac\{1\}\{V\}\left(\frac\{\partial V\}\{\partial p\}\right)_\{T,N\}>0$
for stability against spontaneous volume (or density) fluctuations.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig3.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

In general $\left(\frac\{\partial T\}\{\partial S\}\right)_\{V,N\}>0$,
$-\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial V\}\right)_\{T,N\}>0$ or
$\left(\frac\{\partial \mu_i\}\{\partial N_i\}\right)_\{T,V,N_\{j \neq i\}\}>0$,
represent a set of stability criteria against spontaneous energy ,
volume (or density), or matter flow of species *i* fluctuations,
respectively. These criterion always involve derivatives of intensive
properties with respect to their conjugate extensive properties.
However, these stability concepts, which derive from the second law of
thermodynamics, say nothing about the sign of:

$$\label\{Eq10\}
\left(\frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial T\}\right)_\{V,N\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} \text\{and\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} \left(\frac\{\partial \mu_i\}\{\partial N_k\}\right)_\{T,V,N_\{j \neq k\}\}$$

since the variables are not conjugate to each other
(Fig [\[fig:3\]](#fig:3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:3"\}).

## Phase Equilibrium

In order to describe the phase equilibrium we need a model that property
describes the vapor and the liquid phases. One popular model is the Van
der Waals equation of state given by:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \label\{Eq11\}
p = \frac\{NRT\}\{V-Nb\}-\frac\{aN^2\}\{V^2\}= \frac\{RT\}\{v-b\}-\frac\{a\}\{v^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig4.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

where $v=V/N$ is the molar volume.

Although $a$ and $b$ are considered empirical constant, there are
microscopic justifications for the van der Waals constants:

-   The constant $b$ represents the hard-core excluded volume of the
    molecules in the system.

-   The constant $a$ determines the strength of the two-body attractive
    interaction between molecules in the system

For simplicity, we write the dimensionless equation of state:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq12\}
\tilde\{p\} = \frac\{1\}\{\tilde\{v\} - 1\} - \frac\{\tilde\{a\}\}\{\{\tilde\{v\}\}^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{p\}=\frac\{pb\}\{RT\}$, $\tilde\{v\}=\frac\{v\}\{b\}$, and
$\tilde\{a\}=\frac\{a\}\{bRT\}$, thus reducing the number of parameters to
just $\tilde\{a\}$ to capture the temperature dependence.

Consider the closed, isothermal system containing a van der Waals fluid
in vapor-liquid equilibrium
(Fig. [\[fig:4\]](#fig:4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:4"\}). Our
goals are to find the limits of stability of each phase, the conditions
where the phases coexist, and the properties of the two phases in
coexistence. The simple example of phase coexistence demonstrates the
essential issues at work in more complex, multi-component, multiphase
systems.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig5.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

From the plot of the pressure as a function of volume for a given
$\tilde\{a\}$ (Fig. [\[fig:5\]](#fig:5)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:5"\}), we can observe a region of large volume which is
the vapor phase, a region of liquid phase with low volumes, and a region
in between. This region in between is in violation of thermodynamic
stability, which requires that
$\kappa_T=-\frac\{1\}\{v\}\left(\frac\{\partial v\}\{\partial p\}\right)_\{T\}>0$.

The **limit of stability** of a single pure phase occurs when:

$$\left(\frac\{\partial \tilde\{p\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\}\right)_\{\tilde\{a\}\} = -\frac\{1\}\{(\tilde\{v\}-1)^2\}+\frac\{2\tilde\{a\}\}\{\{\tilde\{v\}\}^3\}=0 \notag$$

This gives the cubic equation:
$$-\{\tilde\{v\}\}^3+2\tilde\{a\}\left(\{\tilde\{v\}\}^2-2\tilde\{v\}+1\right)=0 \notag$$

Equation ([\[Eq12\]](#Eq12)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq12"\}) has
three solutions:

-   The first solution is less than one ($\tilde\{v\}<1$) and is
    unphysical since the pressure $\tilde\{p\}$ diverges as
    $\tilde\{v\}\rightarrow1_+$.

-   The two solutions greater than $\tilde\{v\}=1$ identify the limits of
    stability of the vapor and liquid phases.

The two solutions are approach each other with decreasing $\tilde\{a\}$,
until that meet at the critical point:

$$\tilde\{v\}_c=3 \hspace\{1.0cm\} \text\{and\} \hspace\{1.0cm\} \tilde\{a\}_c=\frac\{27\}\{8\} \notag$$

In order to avoid this violation of thermodynamic equilibrium, the
system undergoes to a state of **phase coexistence**. In order to find
the properties of this coexisting phase we consider the equilibrium
conditions $\mu^\{(v)\}=\mu^\{(l)\}$ and $p^\{(v)\}=p^\{(l)\}=p_\{coex\}$.

The molar Helmholtz free energy is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq13\}
\tilde\{f\}&=\frac\{F\}\{NRT\}=\int\left(\frac\{\partial \tilde\{f\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\}\right)_\{\tilde\{a\}\}d\tilde\{v\} + \tilde\{f\}_0 \notag \\ 
&=-\int \tilde\{p\}d\tilde\{v\} + \tilde\{f\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{f_0\}$ is an unspecified constant of integration (reference
state).

On the other hand, we can derive an expression for the chemical
potential from the Gibbs free energy. The Euler equation for a
one-component system is: $$N\mu = U-ST +pV = F+pV=G \notag$$

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig6.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/phase_equilibrium/Fig9.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

or in dimensionless form, we have: $$\label\{Eq14\}
\tilde\{\mu\} = \frac\{\mu\}\{RT\}= \tilde\{f\}+\tilde\{p\}\tilde\{v\}$$

Since the system is in equilibrium the chemical potential of the vapor
and liquid phases must be equal
($\{\tilde\{\mu\}\}^\{(v)\}=\{\tilde\{\mu\}\}^\{(l)\}$), which according to
([\[Eq13\]](#Eq13)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq13"\}) and
([\[Eq14\]](#Eq14)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq14"\}) is equivalent
to: $$\label\{Eq31\}
\int_\{\{\tilde\{v\}\}^\{(l)\}\}^\{\{\tilde\{v\}\}^\{(v)\}\}\tilde\{p\}(\tilde\{v\})d\tilde\{v\} = \tilde\{p\}_\{coex\}\left(\{\tilde\{v\}\}^\{(v)\}-\{\tilde\{v\}\}^\{(l)\}\right)$$

As written, this leads us to the Maxwell construction for vapor-liquid
phase coexistence, which provides a graphical method of identifying
phase coexistence.

A second way to view the coexistence condition is to note:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq33\}
&\tilde\{\mu\}^\{(v)\} = \tilde\{\mu\}^\{(l)\} \rightarrow \tilde\{f\}^\{(v)\} -\frac\{\partial \tilde\{f\}^\{(v)\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\}\tilde\{v\}^\{(v)\}= \rightarrow \tilde\{f\}^\{(l)\} -\frac\{\partial \tilde\{f\}^\{(l)\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\}\tilde\{v\}^\{(l)\} \notag\\
&\tilde\{p\}^\{(v)\} = \tilde\{p\}^\{(l)\} \rightarrow \frac\{\partial \tilde\{f\}^\{(v)\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\} = \frac\{\partial \tilde\{f\}^\{(l)\}\}\{\partial \tilde\{v\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This development gives the common-tangent construction
(Fig. [\[fig:6\]](#fig:6)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:6"\},
[\[fig:9\]](#fig:9)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:9"\}).

The most direct method of visualizing the coexistence condition is plot
$\tilde\{\mu\}$ versus $\tilde\{p\}$. Numerically calculating the
equilibrium conditions is easiest using the plot of $\tilde\{\mu\}$ versus
$\tilde\{p\}$, since the conditions involve a single point of crossing
(Fig. [\[fig:7\]](#fig:7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:7"\},
[\[fig:8\]](#fig:8)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:8"\}).

The conditions on the $\tilde\{v\}-\tilde\{p\}$ plane that correspond to the
coexistence points form the binodal curves. The limit of stability of
the pure vapor and pure liquid phases form the spinodal curves. These
curve form the phase diagram, which predicts the conditions of
coexistence of the vapor and liquid phases
(Fig. [\[fig:10\]](#fig:10)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig:10"\}).
