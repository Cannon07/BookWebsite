\"\"\" The computational prediction of atomistic structure is a
long-standing problem in physics, chemistry, materials, and biology.
Within conventional force-field or ab initio calculations, structure is
determined through energy minimization, which is either approximate or
computationally demanding. Alas, the accuracy-cost trade-off prohibits
the generation of synthetic big data records with meaningful energy
based conformational search and structure relaxation output. In this
talk, Graph-To-Structure (G2S \[1\]), a graph-based kernel ridge
regression model for structure prediction, will be presented. Exploiting
implicit correlations among relaxed structures, G2s generalizes across
chemical compound space, enabling direct predictions of relaxed
structures for out-of-sample compounds, and effectively bypassing the
energy optimization task. Examples of G2S applicability include closed
shell (QM9 \[2\]) and open shell (QMSpin \[3\]) molecules, transition
states (QMrxn20 \[4\]) and solids (Elpasolites \[5\]). Moreover, the
usefulness of G2S will be shown as an improved initial guess to
subsequent ab initio based relaxation, as well as an input for structure
based quantum machine learning models \[6\]. \"\"\"
