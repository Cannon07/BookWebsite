Some of the most interest vector spaces in physics and machine learning
are infinite dimensional. The words infinite-dimensional can be scary to
beginners, so this chapter provides examples of concrete infinite
dimensional spaces that are built on familiar mathematical concepts. A
Hilbert space is an important special case of infinite dimensional on
which there exists a natural inner product.

## Spaces of functions

Let $a, b \in \mathbb\{R\}$ denote an interval $[a, b]$. Let
$f: [a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$ and $g: [a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$ both be
functions. Note then that for $c, d\in \mathbb\{R\}$, we have that
$cf, dg$ are both functions $[a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$. Similarly, $f+g$ is
a function $[a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$. Combining these two facts, we have
that $cf + dg$ is a function. It follows that the set of such functions
forms a vector space. Often times, the space of all functions is too
big, so we restrict to continuous functions. We denote the space of all
continuous functions from $[a, b]\to \mathbb\{R\}$ as
$C([a, b],\mathbb\{R\})$.

We can define an inner product on this vector space.

$$\braket\{f|g\} = \int_a^b f g dx$$ The physicists reading along might
find this notation evocative. For the rest of our readers, you'll learn
more about this \"bra-ket\" notation later in this book when we cover
some quantum mechanics.

## Hilbert Spaces \{#hilbert-spaces\}

Let's start off with an abstract definition of a Hilbert space then
explain the intuition behind it.

A *Hilbert Space* $\mathcal\{H\}$ is a complex vector space on which there
is an inner product $\langle x | y \rangle$ which associates to each
pair of elements $x, y \in \mathcal\{H\}$ a complex number and which
satisfies the following properties

1.  $\langle y | x \rangle = \overline\{\langle x | y \rangle\}$: The
    inner product is conjugate symmetric

2.  $\langle a x_1 + b x_2 | y \rangle = a \langle x_1 | y \rangle + b \langle x_2 | y \rangle$

3.  If $x \neq 0$, then $\langle x | x \rangle > 0$ and if $x = 0$ then
    $\langle x | x \rangle = 0$

We also require that $\mathcal\{H\}$ be *complete*, that is limits must
exist in the space. Let's consider a more concrete example: The sequence
space $\ell^2$ is given by the set of infinite sequences
$\mathbf\{z\} = (z_1, z_2, \dotsc)$ such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_\{n=1\}^\infty |z_n|^2 < \infty
\end\{aligned\}$$ The inner product is defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle \mathbf\{z\} | \mathbf\{w\} \rangle = \sum_\{n=1\}^\infty z_n \overline\{w_n\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

As another example, let $L^2([a, b])$ be the space of functions
$f:[a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$ Let the inner product be defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle f | g \rangle = \int_a^b f(x)g(x) dx
\end\{aligned\}$$ $L^2([a, b])$ becomes a Hilbert space under this inner
product.

## Exercises

1.  Let $\{\left | q\right \rangle \}$ be an orthonormal basis for
    Hilbert space $\mathcal\{H\}$. Prove that
    $$\sum_i \left | q \right \rangle \left \langle q \right | = I$$
    where $I$ is the identity operator on the Hilbert space
    $\mathcal\{H\}$. []\{#operatoridentity label="operatoridentity"\}

2.  Prove that $\ell^2$ is a Hilbert space according to our definition.

3.  Prove that $L^2([a, b])$ is a Hilbert space according to our
    defnition.
