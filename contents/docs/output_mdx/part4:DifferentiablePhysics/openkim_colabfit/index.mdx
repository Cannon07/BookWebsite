## Introduction

New computers have enabled more accurate predictions with more rigorous
models for molecular simulations. Post HF to DFT to Multi-body
potentials to Pair potentials provide a ladder of approximations.

There are many possibilities. For example, over 60 interatomic
potentials have been designed for silicon alone. For example, the
Stillinger-Weber silicon approximation predicts silicon is ductile while
it is actually brittle. Choice of interatomic potential is important.

The major challenge for ML potential development is data. OpenKim is
online infrastructure for testing and deploying interatomic potentials.
Colabfit is a database of data for interatomic potential fitting. Many
databases only store ground state energies, while we need access to
non-equilibrium energies to train non-equilibrium energies. See at
[colabfit.org](colabfit.org)\{.uri\}. The database includes 50 datasets.
Builds on the OpenCatalyst database. All of this is stored in MongoDB.

KLIFF (Kim-based Learning Integrated Fitting Framework) is a new
framework that finds a niche between DeepMDKit and Torch/Jax MD. It
supports deployment to LAMMPS and multi-GPU training. It also support
uncertainty quantification techniques. Includes LibDescriptor, a
differentiable descriptor library written in C++. OpenKim
[openkim.org](openkim.org)\{.uri\} has been running since 2009. Has a
chat-system ChatKIM to help the user select an appropriate recommender
system.
