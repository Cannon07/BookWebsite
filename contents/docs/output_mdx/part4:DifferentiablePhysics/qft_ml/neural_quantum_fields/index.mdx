The physical theories we've considered so far all have had finite sets
of parameters. But for many more complex physical systems, we find that
we're interested in modeling systems with an infinite number of
parameters. Neural Field Theory provides a mechanism to directly model
fields, both classical and quantum, with differentiable programs.

We define a scalar field $$\begin\{aligned\}
\varphi: \mathbb\{R\}^4 \to \mathbb\{R\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where we use $\mathbb\{R\}^4$ to denote spacetime. This
function can be directly approximate by a suitable neural architecture
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\varphi &= f_\theta
\end\{aligned\}$$

We call such a representation a neural field.

## Electromagnetic Neural Fields

We can represent the electric and magnetic fields $E(x)$ and $B(x)$ as
neural fields. We can also represent the electromagnetic tensor
$F^\{\mu \nu\}$ as a field. This formulation is Lorentz equivariant by
construction. Maxwell's equations can be placed as a PINNs-style
constraint upon the learned field.

## Neural Quantum Fields

Neural quantum fields provide a technology to approximate quantum
fields. Recall that a quantum field is given to first approximation by
an element of type $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^4_+ \to \mathcal\{B\}(\mathcal\{H\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\mathbb\{R\}^4_+$ is Minkowski space. A quantum
field associates to each point of Minkowski space a bounded operator on
Hilbert space.

Recall that neural operators provide a technology for approximating
operators on function spaces. A neural quantum field is thus given by a
function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^4_+ &\to \textrm\{NeuralOperator\} \\
    (x, y, z, t) &\mapsto A_\{\theta, (x,y,z, t)\}(\cdot)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $A_\{\theta, (x,y,z, t)\}(\cdot)$ is a parameterized
neural operator. The neural operator can be defined so that it is not
dependent on the choice of discretization as we have seen in earlier
chapters.

The core insight of the neural quantum field theory approach is that
quantization is a much less mysterious construction in a differentiable
program than in traditional physics. Quantization simply inserts a
$\lambda$ (in the sense of programming language theory). This technique
enables direct study of the fields with simple technology.

### Neural Distributions

The discussion in the previous section is only an approximation, since
quantum fields are more accurately described as operator valued
distributions rather than operator valued functions.

Before tackling the problem of learning an operator valued distribution,
we consider the simpler problem of learning the Dirac delta. Recall that
the Dirac delta is itself a distribution or a generalized function that
maps an input function to its value at the origin $$\begin\{aligned\}
\delta: f \mapsto f(0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

We can encode an approimate Dirac delta as a differentiable program
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\delta(f) \approx g^\{\delta\}_\theta 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $g$ is convolution against a narrow Gaussian.

## Klein Gordon Equation

We can use our framework of neural operators to learn solutions to the
Klein-Gordon equation. The classical Klein-Gordon equation satifies the
equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
(\partial_t^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2)\psi(t, x) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Solutions to this equation satisfy Lorentz invariance and $U(1)$
symmetry by construction. We can then quantize these solutions as in the
classical solution to the quantized Klein-Gordon equation.

The usual solution to the Klein-Gordon equation converts the equation to
Fourier space and notes that at each momentum value, the equation
reduces to the simple harmonic oscillator. The quantization is then
performed by using the ladder operators, just as the harmonic oscillator
is quantized. In our case, we can learn an approximate solution to the
Klein-Gordon equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
f_\theta
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then use the classical commutation rules
$$\begin\{aligned\}
[\phi(x), \phi(y)] &= [\pi(x), \pi(y)] = 0 \\
[\phi(x), \pi(y)] &= i \delta^3(x-y)
\end\{aligned\}$$ to perform the commutation by the following steps. We
can introduce the following forms for $\phi$ and $\pi$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
\phi(x) &= \lambda \psi. f_\theta(x)(\psi) \\
\pi(x) &= \lambda \psi. g_\theta(x)(\psi) \\
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then introduce a loss that penalizes deviations
from the commutation relations $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{L\}_1 &= \int_x \int_y \|[\phi(x), \phi(y)]\|^2 \\
\mathcal\{L\}_2 &= \int_x \int_y \|[\pi(x), \pi(y)]\|^2 \\
\mathcal\{L\}_3 &= \int_x \int_\{y \neq x\} \|[\phi(x), \phi(y)]\|^2 + \int_x \|[\phi(x), \phi(y)] - i\|^2\\
\mathcal\{L\} &= \mathcal\{L\}_1 + \mathcal\{L\}_2 + \mathcal\{L\}_3 + \mathcal\{L\}_4
\end\{aligned\}$$

As a more complex example, we can consider the Klein-Gordon system with
an added vector potential.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Box \psi + \frac\{\partial V\}\{\partial \psi\} &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

We can use the neural field to learn solutions in cases with a vector
potential just as we learned the free field above..

## Dirac Equation

We can use the same methdology to construct a neural field theory for
the Dirac equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
i \hslash \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi(x) - m c\psi(x) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

One complication here is that $\psi(x)$ takes values in spinors, so we
have to place spinorial constraint on our original PINNs-style solver.
Each component of the Dirac equation satisfies the Klein-Gordon field,
so we can use that constraint to help guide the solver.

We can also introduce electromagnetic coupling into the Dirac equation
in a natural way, providing a pathway to apply our methodology to more
complex quantum fields.

## Quantum Electrodynamics

The QED field is a gauge field (consisting of the Dirac field plus
electromagnetic coupling). The Dyson series for the perturbation
expansion can be directly implemented as a differentiable program.

## Quantum Chromodynamics

This same approach can be applied to the Lagrangian for quantum
chromodynamics. A powerful result of this theory is that this
formulation is naturally mesh-free, allowing for the natural
construction of a mesh-free approximate theory of quantum
chromodynamics.
