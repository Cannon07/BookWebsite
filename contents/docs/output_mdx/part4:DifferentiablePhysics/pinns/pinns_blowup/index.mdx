\"\"\" One of the most challenging open questions in mathematical fluid
dynamics is whether an inviscid incompressible fluid, described by the
3-dimensional Euler equations, with initially smooth velocity and finite
energy can develop singularities in finite time. This long-standing open
problem is closely related to one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems
which considers the Navier-Stokes equations, the viscous analogue to the
Euler equations. In this talk, I will describe why and how the
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be a robust and universal
tool to find the smooth self-similar blow-up solution for various fluid
equations, from the simple 1-D burgers equation to the 3-D Euler
equations in the presence of a cylindrical boundary. To the best of our
knowledge, the latter represents the first example of a truly 2-D or
higher dimensional backwards self-similar solution. This sheds new light
to the century-old mystery of capital importance in the field of
mathematical fluid dynamics. \"\"\"

The goal is to solve the incompressible 3D Euler equations. Does there
exist a smooth solution $u_0$ which leads to a solution blowing up in
finite time.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\partial_t u + (u \cdot \nabla )u + \nabpa p &= 0 \\
div(u) &= 0 \\
u(\cdot, t) &= u_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Does there exist a smooth $u_0$ that leads to the solution blowing up?

## Introduction to PINNs

In this structure we use a fully connected network. Consider a simple
differential equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{du\}\{dx\} &= u
\end\{aligned\}$$ Both numerical methods and PINNs convert differential
equations to algebraic equations. Numerical methods do this by finite
difference methods. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{du(x_\{n-1\})\}\{dx\} &= \frac\{u_n - u_\{n-1\}\}\{h\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ To consider PINNs, first consider a fourier series
$$\begin\{aligned\}
u(x) &= \sum_\{n=0\}^N w_n \sin(\frac\{2\pi\}\{L\} n_x + b_n)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can view the fourier series as a type of neural
network. We can gain an exact expression for its derivative. In a PINN,
instead of a fourier series, we can instead use the fully connected
network. Here again we know the explicit derivative from autograd.

PINNs have no truncation error and gives continuous solutions, but can
get trapped in local minima and have higher computational costs than
classical numerical methods.l

## Why can PINNs find Blow-up Solutions?

Recall the incompressible 3D Euler equations above. We will solve these
equations under axi-symmetry. The \"Luo-Huo\" condition provides a case
in which singularities can form within a cylinder when there are two
flows that are rotating on the opposite axis to the cylinder at the
point they meet. The singularity occurs at the point these two vortices
meet. We introduce self-similar coordinates around the singularity
$$\begin\{aligned\}
s &= - \log (\tau_0 - t) \\
y &= (y_1, y_2) &= \frac\{(x_3, r-r_0)\}\{(\tau_0 - t)^\{1+\lambda\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can thhen reformulate into self-similar equation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
(\partial_s + 1) \Omega + ((1 + \lambda) y + U) \cdot \nabla \Omega &= \Phi + E_1 \\
&= ...
\end\{aligned\}$$

We can simplify these equations. If $\lambda \geq -1$ then two of the
terms above simplify down further. It becomes the 2D Boussineq equations
$$\begin\{aligned\}
...
\end\{aligned\}$$ There are several other constraints we have to place on
the solutions. The governing ewquations now have unknown $\lambda$
making this a PDE constrained optimization. We also need smooth
solutions. Discretizations cand truncations can break the blow-up. PINNs
are well suited to addresse these challenges

### Burger's Equation

This equation is known to have a self-similar solution in 1D.
$$\begin\{aligned\}
u_t + u u_x &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Assume self-similar ansatz $$\begin\{aligned\}
u &= (1+t)^\lambda U\left ( \frac\{...\}\{...\}\right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

We can use PINNs to solve Burger's equation as a starting point. It is
possible to find a cusp in the PINNs solution. However it is only a
smooth approximation to a non-smooth solution. You can only approach but
not reach solution.

We need to impose an additional constraint as penalty in order to force
solutions which have smaller errors. $$\begin\{aligned\}
(\partial_\{xxx\} f(x))^2 &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

This gets $\lambda$ very close to the true theoretical value.

### Euler's Equation

First set $\lambda$ up front. The PINN gets close to the Chen-Hou
solution. The analysis gives high error at the origin. We can then add
the higher derivative constraint.

## De Gregorio Equations

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\omega_t + a u \omega_x &= \omega u_x \\
u &= - \int_0^x (H\omega)(s) dz &= \Lambda^\{-1\} \omega
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $H$ is the Hilbert transforms.

## Summary

PINNs provide a differential equation solver that can solve equations
with unknowns and which can find smooth solutions. To convert these
approximate solutions to theoretical solutions, we need to take
additional steps.
