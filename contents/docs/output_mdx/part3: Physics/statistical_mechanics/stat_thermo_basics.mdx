Let $P$ be the pressure and $V$ the volume of some gas. Let $S$ be the
entropy, defined as follows where $T$ is the temperature.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    dS = \frac\{\delta Q\}\{T\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\delta Q$ is used since $Q$ isn't a state variable. We can express
the energy of the system as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    dU &= \delta Q - P dV
\end\{aligned\}$$
