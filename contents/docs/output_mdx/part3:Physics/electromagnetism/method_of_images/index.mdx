The method of images is a technique for solving differential equations
by extending the domain of the sought function to a larger domain with
simpler boundary conditions. This technique is applied most often in
physics to problems in electrostatics.

## Point Charge Above Infinite Plane

Consider a point above an infinite conducting plane as in
Figure [1.1](#fig:point_charge_plane)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:point_charge_plane"\}. A challenge with solving for the
electric field in this scenario is that the point charge induces changes
in the charge distribution on the conducting plane.

The method of images provides a powerful trick for solving such systems.
We leverage the fact that solutions to Laplace's equations are unique to
construct a \"mirror\" system that satisfies the same boundary
conditions at the plane as our original system. We claim that the system
in Figure [1.2](#fig:point_charge_mirrored)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:point_charge_mirrored"\} satisfies the same conditions.

## Point Charge Near a Conducting Sphere

As a next example, we consider a system with a charge near a grounded
conducting sphere as in
Figure [1.3](#fig:point_sphere)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:point_sphere"\}. Unlike the flat plane, the mirror charge
placed inside the sphere will not be directly symmetrically positioned
to the exterior charge, but the same organizing principle holds.
