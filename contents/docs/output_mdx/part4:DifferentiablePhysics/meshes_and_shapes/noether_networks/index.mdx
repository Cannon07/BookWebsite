Noether's theorem draws a deep link between symmetries of a system and
conservation laws. Recent work suggests that Noether's theorem provides
a framework to help learn useful conservation laws for machine learning
applications. This provides a potentially general methodology to
automatically generate inductive biases for a system

## A Brief Review of Noether's Theorem

Noether's theorem is one of the most foundational concepts in modern
physics. Roughly stated, it says that to every symmetry of a physical
system, there is a paired conservation law. For example, if translation
symmetry holds, then linear momentum is conserved.
