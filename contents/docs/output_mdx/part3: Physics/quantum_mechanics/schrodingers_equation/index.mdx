We previously learned about Newton's laws, and Maxwell's equations which
respectively describe how the time evolution of classical mechanical and
electromagnetic systems proceeded. Schrodinger's equation provides an
analogous framework for describing the evolution of quantum mechanical
systems.

## Basic Formulation

Let $\psi(t)$ be the wave function of a quantum mechanical system at
time $t$. Then the wave function evolves over time according to
Schrodinger's equation, written as
$$i \hbar \frac\{d\}\{dt\}|\psi(t) \rangle = \hat\{H\}|\psi(t) \rangle$$ where
$\hat\{H\}$ is an operator, called the *Hamiltonian*, on the space of wave
functions. Given the ubiquity of the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics we
will also often leave off the hat and use a plain $H$ for the
Hamiltonian.

What is the Hamiltonian? We described that the process of quantization
converts classical vectorial or scalar quantitites into operators. One
way of thinking about the Hamiltonian is as the quantization of the
classical energy. Recall quantization involves swapping out scalar
quantities for operators, so we describe the type of the Hamiltonian as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
H: \mathcal\{H\} \to \mathcal\{H\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\mathcal\{H\}$ is the Hilbert space of wave functions. We use
$\mathcal\{H\}$ in place of concrete Hilbert spaces like $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$
or $L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^3)$ since the Hamiltonian formalism holds true for
all of these specific choices. The intuition of Hamiltonian as the
quantized energy drives the definition of many simple Hamiltonians for
quantum systems. Let's look at an example of the usual form of a
Hamiltonian.

$$\hat\{H\} = \frac\{\hat\{p\}^2\}\{2m\} + \hat\{V\}$$ Here $\frac\{\hat\{p\}^2\}\{2m\}$
can be thought of as the kinetic energy operator and $\hat\{V\}$ as the
potential energy operator.

This equation should look familiar to you. If we undo the quantization,
this converts into the classical energy equation
$$E = \frac\{p^2\}\{2m\} + V(x)$$

We can express the Hamiltonian in Physika for the concrete Hilbert space
$L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$ as

``` \{.python language="python"\}
m : $\mathbb\{R\}^+$, V: $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$
def $\hat\{H\}$($\psi$: $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$) $\to$ $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$:
  return $\hat\{p\}^2$($\psi$)/2m + V * $\psi$
```

It is important to note that the choice of Hamiltonian $\bar\{H\}$ is an
act of *modeling*. That is, while the Hamiltonian should generally
correspond to the energy for a system, in practice complex systems often
require simplifications or tweaks. When faced with a new physical
system, there is not one canonical procedure for choosing a Hamiltonian
for a physical system, but the physicist can derive a Hamiltonian that
appears to model the system from first principles or from known
Hamiltonian for simpler systems. As we will see later in this book, it
is even possible to learn an approximate Hamiltonian given sufficient
data about the evolution of a quantum system.

Let us now return to Schrodinger's equation. Rewrite it as follows
$$\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} | \psi \rangle = -i \hbar \hat\{H\} | \psi(t) \rangle$$
This equation is roughly similar to an equation for gradient descent.
Very approximately the Schrodinger's equation describes a form of
gradient descent, by compelling the wave function to evolve in a way
favorable to the energy of the system.

## Forces from Schrodinger's Equation

One qualitative difference in quantum versus classical mechanics is that
we have less reason to work directly with forces. We note that it is
possible to define a force operator $$\begin\{aligned\}
\hat\{F\} &= \frac\{d\}\{dt\} \hat\{p\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ However, it turns out that the more useful quantity is
given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dt\} \langle \hat \{p\} \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ Ehrenfest's theorem shows that the expectation value of
the position operator evolves in a direction controlled by this modified
quantity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    m \frac\{d\}\{dt\} \langle \hat\{x\} \rangle &= \langle \hat\{p\} \rangle  \\
    \frac\{d\}\{dt\} \langle \hat\{p\} \rangle &= - \langle V'(\hat\{x\}) \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$
