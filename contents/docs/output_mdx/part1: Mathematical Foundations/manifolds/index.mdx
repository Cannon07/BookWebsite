Modeling physical systems at times requires us to describe complex
shapes and spaces that aren't just $\mathbb\{R\}^n$. Manifolds provide a
powerful method for describing and analyzing such shapes. We will need
to make use of manifolds for describing systems in general relativity
and quantum mechanics.

We note that it's also common to see the term manifold used informally
in the machine learning literature to describe complex spaces. This
usage is usually more metaphorical than literal but we will attempt to
explore what these statements mean more rigorously.

## Formal Definitions

We start by defining some basic preliminaries from topology to
facilitate our definition. A topological space is a set along a defined
topology (a collection of open sets). A topological space $T$ is
Hausdorff if for any two distinct points $x, y$, there exist disjoint
open sets $U_x$, $U_y$ such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
x \in U_x, y \in U_y, U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset
\end\{aligned\}$$

To give an example, the real numbers $\mathbb\{R\}$ form a Hausdorff
topological space. The open sets for $\mathbb\{R\}$ are given by the open
intervals $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{U\}(\mathbb\{R\}) &= \{ (a, b) | a, b\in \mathbb\{R\}, a < b \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then for any $x, y \in \mathbb\{R\}$, we can choose
disjoint open sets $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (a-\epsilon, a+\epsilon), (b-\epsilon, b+\epsilon)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\epsilon$ is small enough that these sets don't
intersect.

A topological space $T$ is second countable if there exists a sequence
of open sets $U_1, U_2, \dotsc$ such that any open subset of $T$ is a
union of elements of this sequence. The real numbers are second
countable since we can consider the set of open intervals with rational
centers and radiii $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{U\} &= \left \{ \left (\frac\{p\}\{q\} - \frac\{m\}\{n\}, \frac\{p\}\{q\} + \frac\{m\}\{n\} \right ) | p, q, m, n \in \mathcal\{N\} \right \}
\end\{aligned\}$$

A homeomorphism $T: U \to V$ is a continuous function between two
topological spaces $U$ and $V$ which has a continuous inverse. For
example, the exponential map is a homeomorphism $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathrm\{exp\}: \mathbb\{R\} \to \mathbb\{R\}^+
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let $M$ be a topological space. A chart is a homeomorphism
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \varphi: U \to \mathbb\{R\}^n
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and and $\varphi(U)$
is an open subset of $\mathbb\{R\}^n$. A differentiable atlas on
topological space $M$ is a collection of charts $$\begin\{aligned\}
   \mathcal\{A\} &= \{\varphi_i: U_i \to \mathbb\{R\}^n \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \bigcup_i U_i = M
\end\{aligned\}$$ and such that for all $i, j$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \varphi_i \circ \varphi_j^\{-1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a differentiable function. The atlas is said to be
smooth (or $C^\infty$) if the composition function
$\varphi_i \circ \varphi_j^\{-1\}$ are infinitely differentiable.

With these preliminaries in place, we can define a manifold as a
topological space $M$ that is Hausdorff, second-countable, and which has
a differentiable atlas. The manifold is called smooth ($C^\infty$) if
the atlas is smooth.

To take a trivial example, $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ is a manifold where the atlas
consists of one function $\varphi = I$, where $I$ is the identity
function. The intuition behind the definitions is that a manifold
provides a way to describe a space that locally looks like the real
numbers.

Let $M$ be a $C^\{\infty\}$ manifold. A function $f:M \to \mathbb\{R\}$ is
defined to be in $C^\{\infty\}(M)$ if for every chart
$\varphi: U \to \mathbb\{R\}^n$, the composition $f \circ \varphi^\{-1\}$ is
infinitely differentiable.

Let $x \in M$. A derivation $d: C^\{\infty\}(M) \to \mathbb\{R\}$ at $x$ is
a linear map that satisfies the Leibniz rule $$\begin\{aligned\}
    d(fg) = d(f)g + fd(g)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $f, g \in C^\{\infty\}(M)$.

Note that two derivations can be added to one another and multiplied by
scalars in $\mathbb\{R\}$. Hence, the set of derivations forms a real
vector space.

The *tangent space* at $x \in M$, denoted $T_x M$ is the set of
derivations $d$ defined at $x$. The tangent space provides a formal
mechanism to compute the \"tangent lines\" to the manifold at a given
point.

Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. Then the tangent bundle is given
by the disjoint union of the tangent spaces of $M$. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    TM := \bigsqcup_\{x \in M\} T_x M
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Let $x \in M$ be a point and $T_x M$ be
the tangent space at that point. A cotangent vector $\alpha$ at $x$ is a
linear functional $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \alpha: T_x M \to \mathbb\{R\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The set of all cotangent vectors is denoted by
$T_x^* M$. The cotangent bundle $T^* M$ is the disjoint union of the
cotangent spaces of the manifold

## Riemannian Manifolds

A Riemannian Manifold adds a notion of distance to a differentiable
manifold. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Let $g$ be such that for each
$x \in M$, $g_x$ is a positive definite inner product on the vector
space $T_x M$. The tuple $(M, g)$ is a Riemannian manifold.

In general, $g$ is called the metric tensor for the manifold. We note
that $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ is a Riemannian manifold. Note that for any
$x \in \mathbb\{R\}N^n$, the following is a basis of the tangent space
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x_i\} \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that each of these quantities is a derivation by
our rule above and hence a member of the tangent space. Then an
arbitrary element of the tangent space $T_x \mathbb\{R\}^n$ can be written
as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \sum_i a_i \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x_i\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We then define an inner product as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g\left ( \sum_i a_i \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x_i\}, \sum_j b_j \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x_j\} \right ) &= \sum_i a_i b_i
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Exercises
