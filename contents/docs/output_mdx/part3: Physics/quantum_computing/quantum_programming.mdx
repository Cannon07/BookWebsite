Quantum computing has spawned a large number of new programming
languages to design sophisticated quantum algorithms. While quantum
circuits are themselves a simple language for quantum algorithms,
circuits can become verbose. Most quantum algorithms also have repeated
patterns within circuits suggesting that there are higher order patterns
which can be encapsulated and re-sued in circuit design.

In this section, we will discuss a simple extension to Physika that
performs quantum programming. We will design this quantum extension to
enable variational quantum programs which will require us to merge
classical and quantum computations in the same program.

## Syntax for Quantum Gates

Basic gates are provided by simple functions

    X : $H_2 \to H_2$
    Y : $H_2 \to H_2$
    $\sigma_x$ : $H_2 \to H_2$

These operators can be chained together into basic algorithms and
executed the same as any other algorithm. The key differentiator is that
the type must be from a specified Hilbert space to another specified
Hilbert space.
