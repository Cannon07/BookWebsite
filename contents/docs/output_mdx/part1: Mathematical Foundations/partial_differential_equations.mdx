Partial differential equations impose constraints on the partial
derivatives of a function. Intuitively, if you can reason about the
\"local\" behavior of a function from physical principles, you can often
write down a set of relations between these partial derivatives that
your physical system must satisfy. A very broad range of interesting
systems can be specified with partial differential equations and we will
encounter them repeatedly as we explore various physical systems in the
remainder of this book.

However, the generality of partial differential equations comes with the
accompanying limitation that there doesn't exist a general method to
solve such equations. In fact, for any given partial differential
equation of interest, there can be many different partial solutions that
will be of interest to practitioners.

Here's an example of a very simple partial differential equation. Let
$v: \mathbb\{R\}^2 \to \mathbb\{R\}$ be a function. Then we define the
partial differential equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial^2 v\}\{\partial x \partial y\} = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Introducing some common notation, we may also write this equation as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_\{xy\} = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

We claim that any equation of the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
  u(x, y) = f(x) + g(y)  
\end\{aligned\}$$ will be a solution to this equation. Note that this
means that there exists an extremely large solution space of equations
for this simple PDE.

## Notation

We'll start by introducing a few useful bits of notation in this
section. The Laplace operator $\nabla^2$ is defined for a function
$u(x_1, \dotsc, x_n)$ on $n$ variables as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \nabla^2 u = \frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x_1^2\} + \dotsc + \frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x_n^2\} = u_\{11\} + \dotsc + u_\{nn\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Separation of Variables

A common strategy used when solving differential equations is to posit
that the solution has the form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(x, y) &= u(x)v(y)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This assumption often enables us to reduce a partial differentiable
equation to ordinary differential equations. Let's take an example.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial x\} + \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial y\} = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Plugging in the separation of variables assumption we obtain the
equation.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x\} \left ( u(x) v(y)) \right ) + \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial y\} \left ( u(x) v(y) \right) &= 0 \\
    v(y)\frac\{\partial u(x)\}\{\partial x\} + u(x) \frac\{\partial v(y)\}\{\partial y\} &= 0 \\
    v(y) \frac\{\partial u(x)\}\{\partial x\} &= - u(x) \frac\{\partial v(y)\}\{\partial y\} \\
    \frac\{1\}\{u(x)\}\frac\{\partial u(x)\}\{\partial x\} &= -\frac\{1\}\{v(y)\}\frac\{\partial v(y)\}\{\partial y\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that at the last line, left hand side is a function
purely of $x$ and the right hand side is a function purely of $y$. Since
this equality must hold for all $x$ and $y$, both sides must equal a
constant. We thus have two ordinary differential equations

$$\begin\{aligned\}
  \frac\{1\}\{u(x)\}\frac\{\partial u(x)\}\{\partial x\} &= \lambda \\ -\frac\{1\}\{v(y)\}\frac\{\partial v(y)\}\{\partial y\}  &= \lambda \\
\end\{aligned\}$$

These two equations can be solved using the techniques we learned
earlier for ordinary differential equations.

## Fourier Transforms

Another common solution techniques for PDEs is to apply the Fourier
transform to simplify the equation. Fourier transforms satisfy the
property that the time derivative of an input is reduced to a
multiplication in the frequency domain. This property can allow for
considerable simplification of PDEs. We will learn how to use this
technique in later chapters. We note briefly that there are a number of
more advanced transforms such as the inverse scattering transform that
also prove useful for more complex PDE systems.

## Green's Functions

Suppose that $L$ is a linear differential operator that acts on
distributions over $\mathbb\{R\}^n$. Then the Green's function $G(x, s)$
is a distribution over $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ that satisfies the following
equation

$$L G(x, s) = \delta(x -s)$$

Recall that the Dirac delta satisfies the following property

$$\int \delta(x - s) f(s) ds = f(x)$$

Let's plug in the defining equation for a Green's function:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int L G(x, s) f(s) ds &= f(x) \\
    L \left ( \int G(x, s) f(s) ds \right ) &= f(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$

That is, $$\begin\{aligned\}
u = \int G(x, s)f(s) ds
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a solution to the general differential equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
L u = f 
\end\{aligned\}$$

If we can find the Green's function for $L$, we can use it to find
entire families of solutions.

## Discussion

As a parting note in this section, we'll mention that traditionally
partial differential equations have been the \"language\" of classical
physics. Part of the thesis of this book is that differentiable programs
form a more useful common language for physics. The core reasoning
behind this argument is that unlike partial differential equations,
differentiable programs have a universal solution method via gradient
descent.
