Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between that
of a metallic conductor and a nonmetallic insulator. Semiconductors have
a number of interesting physical properties. For one, their resistivity
drops as temperatures rise (unlike metals which have higher resistivity
at higher temperatures). Semiconductors can also have their conducting
properties altered by the addition of \"dopants\", impurities introduced
into the crystal structure of a semiconductor. A substance with two
differently doped regions can form a \"semiconductor junction\".

In this chapter, we introduce the foundations of semiconductor physics
and consider how to build differentiable programs that predict
semiconductor structure and behavior.

## Basic Semiconductor Physics

Semiconductors are marked by their unique conductivity behavior, between
that for conductors and insulators. To understand this behavior more
precisely, we will need to delve into the physics of electronic band
structure. An isolated atom has electrons that occupy atomic orbitals.
What happens to the electronic structure then when two atoms come
together to form a molecule? Pauli's exclusion principle dictates that
two electrons can't have the quantum number in a molecule. This means
that each atomic orbital in a diatomic molecule splits into two
molecular orbitals

Now consider a more complex situation, where $N$ identical atoms come
together to form crystal lattice. In this case, the atomic orbitals of
individual atoms will overlap. The Pauli exclusion principle then
dictates that we can't have two electrons in the solid that have the
same quantum numbers. This forces each atomic orbital for each atom to
split into $N$ discrete molecular orbitals. Macroscopic solids have very
large numbers of atoms, so these $N$ discrete molecular orbitals
effectively form a continuum since the energy gap between adjacent
molecular orbitals will be very small.

### Fermi Level

For a solid state body, the Fermi level is the thermodynamic work
required to add one electron to the body. This quantity is usually
referred to as $\mu$.

### Band Gap

For semiconductors, the band gap is the distance between the valence
band and the conduction band. It represents the amount of energy
required to promote an electron to participating in conduction.

### Bravais Lattice and Reciprocal Lattice

To study the mathematical properties of semiconductor systems, we need
to be able to formulate the repeating lattice structure of the material
in our equations. Let's start by defining a lattice. Conceptually, a
lattice is defined by its unit cell, which is given by three primitive
lattice vectors $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{a_1\}, \vec\{a_2\}, \vec\{a_3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Bravais lattice is the infinite set of points
described by

$$\vec\{r\} = n_1 \vec\{a_1\} + n_2 \vec\{a_2\} + n_3 \vec\{a_3\}, \quad n_1, n_2, n_3 \in \mathbb\{Z\}$$

To model physical crystals, we also need to consider the *primitive unit
cell*. This unit cell is given by

$$\textbf\{r\} = \{x_1 \vec\{a_1\} + x_2 \vec\{a_2\} + x_3 \vec\{a_3\} | 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 < 1 \}$$

We then say that a crystal is an arrangement of atoms within the
primitive unit cell. Note that not all the atoms have to be of the same
type.

## Solving Schrodinger's Equation in Lattices

Let's consider how to solve Schrodinger's equation for particles in a
lattice. Physically, we expect that the potential energy of the system
obeys the following symmetry

$$\begin\{aligned\}
V(\vec\{x\} + \vec\{a\}) = V(\vec\{x\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

That is, the potential energy repeats for each primitive unit cell. The
solutions of Schrodinger's equation for such a system are given by
Bloch's theorem which states that for electrons in a crystal lattice,
with a potential $V$ that obeys the symmetry

$$\begin\{aligned\}
V(\vec\{x\} + \vec\{a\}) = V(\vec\{x\}), 
\end\{aligned\}$$

There exists a basis of wave functions which have the following
properties: Each wave function $\psi_i$ is an energy eigenstate of
Schrodinger's equation. We can write $\psi_i$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_i(r) = e^\{i k \cdot r\} u_i(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where $u(r)$ has the same periodicity as the crystal. That is,
$$\begin\{aligned\}
u(r + \vec\{a\}) = u(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We say that a function with the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_\{i\}(r) = e^\{ik\cdot r\}u_\{i\}(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a Bloch wave. Note that the Block theorem means that
given bloch state can be identified with a wave vector $k$.

## Doping

Doping is the introduction of impurities into semiconductor for the
purpose of changing its properties and behaviors.

P-type semiconductors have electron acceptors embedded into the
underlying semiconductor, whhile N-type semiconductors have electron
donors embedded into the underlying semiconductor.
