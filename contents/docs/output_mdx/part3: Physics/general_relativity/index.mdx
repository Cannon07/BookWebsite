In this chapter, we study the vacuum solution to the Einstein field
equations. This is the case in which no gravitational fields are
present. The only spherically symmetric vacuum solution is called the
Schwarzschild metric

## Mathematical Formulation

The vacuum Einstein field equation is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    G_\{\mu \nu\} &= 0\\
    R_\{\mu \nu\} - \frac\{1\}\{2\}g_\{\mu \nu\}R &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Schwarzschild metric is defined by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    ds^2 *= -(1 - \frac\{2GM\}\{r\})dt^2 + (1 - \frac\{2GM\}\{r\})^\{-1\} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we have $d\Omega^2$ is the metric on the sphere
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    d\Omega^2 &= d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can use this metric to solve for the Christoffel
symbols.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Gamma^t_\{tr\} &= \partial_r \alpha \\
\Gamma^\theta_\{r\theta\} &= \frac\{1\}\{r\} \\
\Gamma^r_\{\phi\phi\} &= -re^\{-2\beta\}\sin^2 \theta \\
\Gamma^r_\{tt\} &= e^\{2(\alpha - \beta)\} \partial_r \alpha \\
\Gamma^r_\{\theta\theta\} &= -re^\{-2\beta\} \\
\Gamma^\theta_\{\phi \phi\} &= -\sin \theta \cos \theta \\
\Gamma^r_\{rr\} &= \partial_r \beta \\
\Gamma^\phi_\{r\phi\} &= \frac\{1\}\{r\} \\
\Gamma^\phi_\{\theta \phi\} &= \frac\{\cos \theta\}\{\sin \theta\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

General relativity is the study of accelerating relativistic systems.
Unlike special relativity (which we studied in
ChapterÂ [\[chap:special_relativity\]](#chap:special_relativity)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:special_relativity"\}), general relativistic systems
require more mathematical foundations from manifolds. In particular, it
becomes necessary to deal with tensors and curvature. A lot of the math
involved in general relativity is different from that used elsewhere in
physics which creates additional complications [@carroll2001no].

Note that when we discuss tensors in this chapter, we are actually
talking about tensor fields on a spacetime. This difference can prove a
source of considerable confusion for newcomers who mistakenly identify
\"tensors\" in machine learning (multidimensional arrays) with the
tensor fields of physics.

## Reviewing Special Relativity

We've previously introduced the basics of special relativity, but we
will review it here as well. Special relativity occurs on a special four
dimensional manifold, the Minkowski spacetime. By convention, the
coordinates of a point in Minkowski space time are written

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    x^\{\mu\} = (t, x, y, z)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here, we assume as we have done earlier that the speed of light $c = 1$.
The elements of the Minkowski spacetime are called events. We also
follow the convention that an event in space time is denoted with a
capital letter $V^\{\mu\}$. (Note the difference with the usual convention
in which elements of a vector space are denoted with lower case
elements). Minkowski spacetime differs from the usual space of
$\mathbb\{R\}^4$ in one critical fashion: distances are computed
differently. In particular we define

$$\eta_\{\mu\nu\} = \begin\{pmatrix\}
    -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0  & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0  & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0  & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end\{pmatrix\}$$

We can then define the inner product between two events $A$ and $B$ as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    A \cdot B &\equiv \eta_\{\mu\nu\} A^\{\mu\} B^\{\nu\} \\
    &= - A^0B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here we are following tensor summation convention that indices mentioned
in both sub and superscripts are implicitly summed over. This convention
lends itself well to describing the distance between two points as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    ds^2 &= \eta_\{\mu\nu\} dx^\{\mu\} dx^\{\nu\} \\
    &= -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is the metric associated with Minkowski space. Note
in particular that distances can be negative. The distance between
$(t, x, y, z)$ and $(2t, x, y, z)$ is negative for example. We
consequently define the proper time infinitesimally as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    d\tau^2 = - ds^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ and define the proper time $\tau$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \tau = \int \sqrt\{-ds^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The choice of metric also suggests a few terms. A vector $V^\{\mu\}$ is
timelike if $V \cdot V < 0$. (Note why this makes sense.) A vector
$W^\{\mu\}$ such that $W \cdot W > 0$ is spacelike, and a vector with 0
norm is called null. A path through spacetime is denoted
$x^\{\mu\}(\lambda)$. We define the four-velocity as
$$U^\{\mu\} = \frac\{dx^\{\mu\}\}\{d\tau\}$$ The definition of the momentum
four-vector follows as $$p^\{\mu\} = m U^\{\mu\}$$ where $m$ is the mass of
a particle.

## General Relativity as a Physical Theory

A pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is a differentiable manifold $M$
equipped with a smooth, symmetric metric tensor $g$. Spacetime
$\mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$ with the usual metric $$\begin\{aligned\}
    -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

The Einstein tensor is defined as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    G_\{\mu \nu\} = R_\{\mu \nu\} - \frac\{1\}\{2\} R g_\{\mu \nu\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $R_\{\mu \nu\}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R$ the scalar
curvature, and $g_\{\mu \nu\}$ is the metric tensor. The Ricci tensor is
defined in terms of the Riemann tensor $$\begin\{aligned\}
R_\{ab\} &= R^\{c\}_\{abc\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Riemann tensor itself is expanded in terms of
Christoffel symbols $$\begin\{aligned\}
R^\{\rho\}_\{\sigma \mu \nu\} &= \partial_\mu \Gamma^\rho_\{\nu \sigma\} - \partial \nu \Gamma^\rho_\{\mu \sigma\} + \Gamma^\rho_\{\mu \lambda\} \Gamma^\lambda_\{\nu \sigma\} - \Gamma^\rho_\{\nu \lambda\} \Gamma^\lambda_\{\mu \sigma\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Einstein gravitational constant is defined as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \kappa = \frac\{8 \pi G\}\{c^4\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $G$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant, and
$c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    G_\{ab\} &= R_\{ab\} - \frac\{R\}\{2\} g_\{ab\} = 8 \pi T_\{ab\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $G_\{ab\}$ is the Einstein tensor, $R_\{ab\}$ is the
Ricci tensor of the spacetime, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $T_\{ab\}$ is
the stress-energy tensor. The Ricci tensor can be expanded in terms of
Christophel symbols as follows:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    R_\{ab\} &= \partial_c \Gamma_\{ab\}^c - \partial_a \Gamma^c_\{cb\} + \Gamma^c_\{cd\}\Gamma^d_\{ab\} - \Gamma^c_\{da\}\Gamma^d_\{cb\} \\
    \Gamma^c_\{ab\} &= \frac\{1\}\{2\}g_\{ab\}(\partial_a g_\{bd\} + \partial_b g_\{ad\} - \partial_d g_\{ab\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

The equations above define a set of 10 coupled partial differential
equations

## General Relativity as a Physical Theory

Let us now formulate general relativity as a physical theory in our
framework. The state space $\mathcal\{S\}$ for general relativity is the
category of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds

Time evolution in general relativity is a bit stranger than it is for
other equations. A solution describes a configuration of spacetime in
which there isn't an explicit notion of time evolution. The equations to
be solved of course are the Einstein field equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    G_\{\mu \nu\} = \Lambda g_\{\mu \nu\} + \kappa T_\{\mu \nu\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $G_\{\mu \nu\}$ is the Einstein tensor.

Parameters are given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\} = \{G, c\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $G$ is the Newtonian gravity constant, and $c$ is
the speed of light in a vacuum. Domain of Applicability $\mathcal\{C\}$
constrains general relativity to only be valid for suitably macroscopic
systems (not quantum scale).

## Exercises

1.  Prove that the four-velocity satisfies the equation
    $$\eta_\{\mu\nu\} U^\{\mu\} U^\{\nu\} = -1$$

A tensor of type $$\begin\{aligned\}
\big ( \begin\{smallmatrix\} 0 \\ N \end\{smallmatrix\} \big )
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a function that maps a collection of $N$ vectors into
a real number. This function must be linear in each argument. For
example, the inner product $\cdot$ is a
$\big(\begin\{smallmatrix\}0 \\ 2 \end\{smallmatrix\} \big)$ tensor since

$$\begin\{aligned\}
(\alpha \vec\{v\}) \cdot \vec\{w\} &= \alpha (\vec\{v\} \cdot \vec\{w\}) \\
(\vec\{v\} + \vec\{w\}) \cdot \vec\{u\} &= \vec\{v\} \cdot \vec\{u\} + \vec\{w\} \cdot \vec\{u\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ (Since the inner product is symmetric, the same
properties hold true in the other argument). The *metric* tensor is
defined to be the tensor corresponding to the inner product
$$\begin\{aligned\}
g(\vec\{v\}, \vec\{w\}) = \vec\{v\} \cdot \vec\{w\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

As another example, if $f$ is a function, then its total derivative $df$
is a $\big(\begin\{smallmatrix\}0 \\ 1 \end\{smallmatrix\}\big)$ tensor
(also called a one-form). More generally, a one form is a function from
vectors to the real numbers.

Note that one-forms form a vector space since functions can be added or
multiplied by a scalar. We can also talk about \"components\" of the
one-form as where they map basis vectors $$\begin\{aligned\}
p_\{\alpha\} &= \tilde\{p\}(\vec\{e\}_\{\alpha\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

The metric tensor provides a ready collection of one-forms defined by
inner products against fixed vectors $$\begin\{aligned\}
g(\cdot, \vec\{w\}) &= \cdot \vec\{w\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

A $\big(\begin\{smallmatrix\}M \\ 0 \end\{smallmatrix\}\big)$ tensor is a
linear function of $M$ one-forms to the real numbers.

Numerical relativity methods study general relavistic spacetimes which
cannot be solved exactly with known methods. Numerical relativity has
recently risen to prominence (at time of writing) due to its role in
helping facilitate the detection of gravitational waves.

## Basic Formulation

One basic but tricky challenge in numerical relativity is that
space-time is a unified entity that doesn't directly split into space
and time as with other PDE systems in physics. For this reason, we must
first perform a foliation of the space we consider into spacelike and
timelike components to split them out.

## Solution Methods

The method of lines is a technique for decoupling treatment of space and
time. Runge-kutta methods can be used to integrate from there.

Filtering operators and dissipation operators provide more sophisticated
spectral methods of simulation which can be crucial for larger systems.
