Euclidean networks bridge the several different types of equivariant
convolutions we have seen (tensor field networks, $SE(3)$ transformers,
steerable convolutional networks) into one common framework.

## Mathematical Framework

Suppose that atomic positions are given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
r \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{3N\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $N$ is the number of atoms. In order to define
more complex equivariant architectures, we need the ability to
manipulate a few basic ingredients. First, we need efficient
implementations of the spherical harmonics and irreducible
representations of common groups. We also need precomputed
implementations of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. Given these core
building blocks, it becomes possible to build a large range of
equivariant networks.
