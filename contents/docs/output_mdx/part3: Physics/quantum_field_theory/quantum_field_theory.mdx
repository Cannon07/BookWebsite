Quantum field theory builds machinery to handle relativistic quantum
mechanical systems with an unbounded number of particles. This chapter
will introduce considerable mathematical machinery, but we will aim to
motivate this machinery by tying back to examples you've already studied
at depth through this book.

## Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

The standard form of Schrodinger's equation we have seen thus far is not
relativistically invariant. Quantum field theory arose from attempts to
modify Schrodinger's equation to become relativistically invariant by
modifying the base form of Schrodinger's equation to respect Lorentz
invariance. The Klein-Gordon equation provides a simple first
relativistically invariant variant of Schrodinger's equation for
spinless particles without interactions.

The Dirac equation extends the base Klein-Gordon equation to add spin,
necessary to model particles such as electrons, but requires the
introduction of more sophisticated machinery in terms of spinors. We
will return to this equation shortly.

## Quantum Field Theory

The basic idea of second quantization is that fields themselves need to
be promoted to operator quantities in order to model quantum
field-theoretic systems. This is called second quantization as opposed
to first quantization, which is the procedure used for classical
quantities like position and momentum.

## Quantum Field Theory as a Physical Theory

States $\mathcal\{S\}$ are given by Hilbert space $\mathcal\{H\}$ of wave
functions as we saw earlier for quantum mechanics, but we will need to
use a larger Hilbert space. In particular, we will choose the Fock
space. Let's quickly motivate this construction. The suitable Hilbert
space for particle is $\mathcal\{H\} = L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^3)$. The Hilbert
space for $n$ particles is the tensor product $\mathcal\{H\}^\{\otimes n\}$.
Let $S_+$ be the tensor symmetrization operator. Then the bosonic Fock
space is

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 F_+(\mathcal\{H\}) = \overline\{\bigoplus_\{n=0\}^\infty S_+(\mathcal\{H\}^\{\otimes n\}\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The bar above indicates the Hilbert space completion. This definition is
a little complicated to digest, but you can think of it as allowing for
quantum states of arbitrarily many particles.

What then is a field? In mathematical language, a field $\phi$ is an
operator-valued distribution defined on $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$. That is,
$\phi$ maps functions in $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$ to operators. If we squint
we can pretend that points in $\mathbb\{R\}^3$ are points in
$F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$. (Pretend the Dirac delta $\delta_x$ at
$x \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is in $\mathcal\{H\} = L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^n)$. Then the
field $\phi$ maps $\delta_x$ to an operator. That is, there is an
operator for every point of space!)

For symmetries $\mathcal\{G\}$, unlike in nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics, it is more convenient to define a quantum field theory by its
Lagrangian. Here we describe a simple field theory with quartic
self-interaction

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \mathcal\{L\} = \frac\{1\}\{2\} (\partial_\{\mu\} \phi) (\partial^\{\mu\} \phi) - \frac\{1\}\{2\} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\} \phi^4 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\mathcal\{L\}$ is another operator-valued distribution. As a
mathematical note, the Hilbert space $F_+(\mathcal\{H\})$ we defined above
isn't right. You can pretend we still live in this space, but it's an
open mathematical problem to find the \"correct\" space.

We define the time evolution operator $U(t_2, t_1)$ to be the operator
such that $$\begin\{aligned\}
 | \psi(t_2) \rangle = U(t_2, t_1) |\psi(t_1) \rangle 
\end\{aligned\}$$ This time evolution operator can be expanded in terms of
the Dyson series $$\begin\{aligned\}
U(t_2, t_1) &= T\left [ \exp \left ( -i \int_\{t_1\}^\{t_2\} dt H_I(t) \right ) \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $T$ is the time ordering operator and $H_I$ is the interaction
Hamiltonian. Parameters are given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\} = \{m, \lambda, |\psi(0)\rangle \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m$, $\lambda$ are the \"bare mass\" and \"bare
coupling constant\" and $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial condition of
the wave function.

The domain of Applicability $\mathcal\{C\}$ is set by constraints Mass
$m_r < M$ where $m_r$ is the physically measureable mass and $M$ is some
ceiling parameter. Hyperparameters $\mathcal\{HP\}$ are $M$, the mass
limit, and noise parameter $\epsilon$

## Mathematical Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce a few additional pieces of mathematical
infrastructure that we will find useful in subsequent chapters.

### Scattering Matrix

Physical observables in quantum field theory are generally written in
terms of the scattering matrix $S$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
 S = \lim_\{t_2 \to \infty\} \lim_\{t_1 \to -\infty\} U(t_2, t_1) 
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is called a \"matrix\", since the intuition is that
term $\langle \psi_i | S | \psi_j \rangle$ captures the probability of
\"basis state\" $\psi_j$ transitioning to $\psi_i$ over infinite time.
If the input and output states are well chosen, this term can be
estimated from experiment with some noise $\textrm\{Normal\}(0, \epsilon)$

### Second Quantization

Let's define the number operator $N$
$$N = \sum_i \hat\{a\}_i^\{\dagger\} \hat\{a\}_i$$ The number operator counts
the number of particles in a system. Here $\hat\{a\}_i^\dagger$ is the
creation operator and $\hat\{a\}_i$ is the annihilation operator.

### Operator Valued Distributions

Quantum fields are typically mathematically modeled as operator valued
distributions. Conceptually, this corresponds to a type of generalized
function that maps each point in space time to a given operator. This
mathematical abstraction is known to be leaky though, since multiplying
two distributions is often an ill-specified operation, making it
difficult to model interacting quantum fields.
