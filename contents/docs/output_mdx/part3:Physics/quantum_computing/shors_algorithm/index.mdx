Shor's algorithm provides a method to factor large numbers into their
prime factors using a quantum circuit. The method embeds the problem of
prime factoring into an invocation of the quantum fourier transform,
allowing for an efficient solution. Although not directly related to a
physical system, there are deep connections between number theory, the
prime numbers, and physics, so we highlight the method in this chapter.
