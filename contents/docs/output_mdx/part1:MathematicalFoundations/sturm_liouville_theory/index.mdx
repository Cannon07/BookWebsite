Sturm-Liouville theory studies equations of the form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dx\} \left [ p(x) \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} \right ] + q(x) y = - \lambda w(x) y
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $p(x)$, $q(x)$, and $w(x)$ are arbitrary
coefficient functions and $y$ is a function of $x$ that we wish to solve
for. $\lambda$ here is a free parameter that is not specified in the
equation and part of solving a Sturm-Liouville problem involves finding
$\lambda$

We can write this equation in differential operator form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Lu &= -\frac\{1\}\{w(x)\} \left ( \frac\{d\}\{dx\} \left [ p(x) \frac\{du\}\{dx\} \right ] + q(x) u \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

We want to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this equation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Lu = \lambda u
\end\{aligned\}$$

Under some regularity conditions, the eigenfunctions of different
Sturm-Liouville equations form interesting orthogonal bases which we
will see again in multiple contexts throughout the book.

## Bessel Equation

The Bessel equation is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    x^2 \frac\{d^2y\}\{dx^2\} + x \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} + (x^2 - \nu^2) y = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ By leveraging the product rule, the two terms on the
left of the above equation can be grouped after we divide the Bessel
equation through by $x$. $$\begin\{aligned\}
   x \frac\{d^2y\}\{dx^2\} + \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} + (x - \frac\{\nu^2\}\{x\}) y &= 0\\
   \frac\{d\}\{dx\} \left (x \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} \right) + \left (x - \frac\{\nu^2\}\{x\} \right) y &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Legendre Equation

The Legendre equation is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    (1 - x^2)\frac\{d^2 y\}\{dx^2\} - 2 x \frac\{dy\}\{dx\} + \nu (\nu + 1) y &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here we once again apply the chain rule to the two terms on the left to
obtain

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dx\} \left ( (1 - x^2)\frac\{dy\}\{dx\}  \right ) + \nu (\nu + 1) y &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Solution Space of the Sturm-Liouville Equation

As we mentioned briefly above, we can think of the Sturm-Liouville
equation as an operator equation. We seek solutions $$\begin\{aligned\}
    u \in L^2([a, b], w(x)dx)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This notation indicates that the inner product on the
space is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle f, g \rangle &= \int_a^b \overline\{f(x)\} g(x) w(x) dx
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Exercises

1.  Prove that the eigenfunctions of the Sturm-Liouville equation
    $$\begin\{aligned\}
            L u &= -\frac\{d^2 u\}\{dx^2\} = \lambda u
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ with boundary constraints $$\begin\{aligned\}
            u(0) = u(\pi) = 0
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ are given by the Fourier basis of sinusoidal
    functions.
