This chapter introduces some basic mathematical definitions used
throughout the reminder of this book.

## Sets, Groups, Rings, and Fields

Pure mathematics studies mathematical objects, abstractions of patterns
found in the real world. The simplest such object is a set. Think of a
set as a collection of unique objects. Sets are typically denoted as
follows

$$X = \{a, b, c\}$$

Curly braces are used to denote the elements of a set. Here $X$ is a set
that contains 3 distinct elements $a, b, c$. We note the empty set which
contains no elements by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$. We denote membership in a
set by the notation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    a \in X
\end\{aligned\}$$ read as \"a in x\". Set theory is traditionally used as
the foundation of mathematics. It's possible to define all the usual
mathematics we use in terms of sets. Let's introduce some basic sets
which we will run into often. The set of natural numbers
$$\mathbb\{N\} = \{0, 1, 2, \cdots\},$$ is the set of all whole numbers
from $0$ upwards. The set of integers
$$\mathbb\{Z\} = \{\cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \cdots \},$$ is the set of all
whole numbers positive and negative. The rational numbers contain
fractions.
$$\frac\{1\}\{3\}, \frac\{-23\}\{68\}, \frac\{1234234242\}\{23423423423425\}, \cdots$$

The real numbers $\mathbb\{R\}$ are the set of positive and negative
decimal numbers with infinite decimal places. For example
$$\pi = 3.1415926535\cdots$$

The set of complex numbers $\mathbb\{C\}$ contains one addition to the
real numbers, denoted by $i$, the imaginary number. $i$ has the property
that $$i^2 = -1$$ Elements of the complex numbers are denoted by
$a + ib$. Complex numbers are important for formulating mathematical
models of quantum mechanics.

These different sets are included once inside the other as follows

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{N\} \subset \mathbb\{Z\} \subset \mathbb\{Q\} \subset \mathbb\{R\} \subset \mathbb\{C\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

We will also often find ourselves working with tuples of these
quantities $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^2 = \mathbb\{R\} \times \mathbb\{R\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, the elements of $\mathbb\{R\}^2$ are tuples
$(a,b)$ where $a, b \in \mathbb\{R\}$.

### Set Theoretic Definitions of Numbers

As a quick note, traditionally numbers themselves are defined as sets.
Here's one way to define the natural numbers as sets $$\begin\{aligned\}
0 &:= \{\} \\
1 &:= \{0\} \\
2 &:= \{0, 1\} \\
\vdots
\end\{aligned\}$$ The definition of the real numbers is more complex, but
follows from similar constructions. We won't go into this more deeply
here.

### A Quick Introduction to Groups

A *group* is a special kind of set that has an operation defined on it.
This operation is typically denoted by $+$ or $\times$. We've already
seen one simple example of a group, the set $\mathbb\{Z\}$. In this case,
the group operation $+$ is the same as the usual addition. A group must
satisfy a few formal *group laws*.

1.  Identity: The element $0$ is an identity for $\mathbb\{Z\}$ since for
    all $n \in \mathbb\{Z\}$, we have $n + 0 = 0 + n = 0$

2.  Associativity: The operation $+$ associates. That is,
    $n + (m + \ell) = (n + m) + \ell$

3.  Inverses: For any element $n \in \mathbb\{Z\}$, the element $-n$ is
    its inverse since $n + (-n) = (-n) + n = 0$

If you haven't seen formal group laws before, don't worry too much about
them. We'll see a number more groups in various physical applications
later in the book which should help provide more intuition.

### A Brief Introduction to Rings

A *ring* is similar to a group but with the addition of a second
operation, traditionally denoted by $\times$ as multiplication. This
multiplication is unlike the group operation in that inverses for
elements aren't required. For example, $\mathbb\{Z\}$ is a ring, with $+$
the group operation and $\times$ (the usual multiplication) the ring
operation. Here $1$ is the multiplicative identity, since for any
$n \in \mathbb\{Z\}$, we have $n \times 1 = 1 \times n = n$. However, we
don't have an inverse operation. Note that for $2$ for example, the
multiplicative inverse would be $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$, which isn't an element of
$\mathbb\{Z\}$.

A field is a ring where the multiplication operation $\times$ is
invertible for every element except $0$. This operation is denoted
division and is given by $/$. The set of rational numbers $\mathbb\{Q\}$
is a field, since for $\frac\{n\}\{m\} \in \mathbb\{Q\}$, the multiplicative
inverse is simply $\frac\{m\}\{n\}$ (assuming $m \neq 0$). The real numbers
$\mathbb\{R\}$ and the complex numbers $\mathbb\{C\}$ are fields as well.

## Functions

A function is a mapping from one set into another. If $A, B$ are sets,
then we denote a function from $A$ to $B$ as $f: A \to B$ (read the
notation as \"A to \"B\"). You can think of a function as a machine that
given an element of $A$ that spits out an element of $B$.

### Exercises

1.  Consider the set $\{0, 1\}$ with addition defined as
    $$\begin\{aligned\}
            0 + 0 &= 0\\
            1 + 0 &= 0 + 1 = 1\\
            1 + 1 &= 0
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$ Prove that this set is a group.

2.  A polynomial is a function of the form
    $$f(x) = a_n x^n + a_\{n-1\}x^\{n-1\} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$ where
    $a_i$ is an element of some ring $R$. For example, for the ring
    $\mathbb\{Z\}$, we have that $$g(x) = 4x^3 + 3 x^2 + 2 x + 1$$ is a
    polynomial. Denote the set of polynomials over $R$ as
    $\mathcal\{P\}(R)$.

    1.  Prove that $\mathcal\{P\}(R)$ is a group. What is the group
        operation? Prove that it follows the group laws.

    2.  Prove that $\mathcal\{P\}(r)$ is a ring. What is the ring
        operation? Prove that it follows the ring laws.
