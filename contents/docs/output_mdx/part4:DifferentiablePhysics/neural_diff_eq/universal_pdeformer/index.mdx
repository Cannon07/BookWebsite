Idea: Pretrain a transformer on diff-eq (ODE/PDE) trajectories from many
different types of PDEs. Use a mesh representation of the PDE data to
allow for data from different mesh resolutions. Also include a basic
representation of the transformer equation as one of the core data
inputs to the transformer. The pretrained model should then be capable
of predicting forward in time multiple different types of PDEs.

This system could be useful then for multiscale physics. The transformer
can jointly model a system such as a QM/MM system (say a protein enzyme
with a catalytic region), or possibly a weather system. The joint
transformer could also dynamically decide which regions to drop down to
a higher resolution PDE simulation in order to run at larger timescales.

This system could also train on MD trajectories. The challenge would be
to handle very long trajectories for training and to enforce correctness
constraints.
