## Notes

Rough idea is that we can train a foundation model on many molecular
dynamics trajectories. Use that to create a universal model for
accelerated MD simulation. This could serve to model allosteric binders.
This could allow for a scalable version of DESRES/Anton's engine and
could lead to discovery of new compounds. Core idea is coarse graining
but trained across a broad range of proteins to create novel IP.
