In this chapter, we define about the orbital angular momentum operator
$L$ and total angular momentum operator $J$. Recall that classical
angular momentum is a vector $\vec\{L\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is defined by
the cross product equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{L\} &= \vec\{r\} \times \vec\{p\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where $\vec\{r\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is the position vector and
$\vec\{p\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is the momentum vector. To define the
analogous quantum mechanical operation, we convert these quantities into
operators.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    L &= r \times p
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $r$ and $p$ are the position and momentum operators. Recall that
these are vector operators

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    r &= (r_x, r_y, r_z) \\
    p &= (p_x, p_y, p_z)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Where $r_x$, $p_x$ etc are operators. Component wise,
the vector is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    L &= (L_x, L_y, L_z) \\
    &= (r_y p_z - r_z p_y, r_x p_z - r_z p_x, r_x p_y - r_y p_x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ are themselves
operators.

## Commutation Relations

The angular momentum operators satisfy the following commutation
relationships

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [L_x, L_y] &= i \hbar L_z \\
    [L_y, L_z] &= i \hbar L_x \\
    [L_z, L_x] &= i \hbar L_y
\end\{aligned\}$$

We will prove the first of these commutation relationships explicitly
and leave the other relationships to the exercises.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [L_x, L_y] &= [r_y p_z - r_z p_y, ]
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Exercises

1.  Prove the other two commutation relationships $$\begin\{aligned\}
        [L_y, L_z] &= i \hbar L_x \\
        [L_z, L_x] &= i \hbar L_y
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$
