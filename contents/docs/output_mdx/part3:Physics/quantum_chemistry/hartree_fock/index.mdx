Quantum chemists have built up a large family of methods to
approximately solve Schrodinger's equation for large chemical systems.

## Hartree-Fock Methods

A very simple ansatz for the joint wave function of a $N$ electrong
system is given by the product of per-atom wave functions.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi(r_1,\dotsc,r_N) &= \phi(r_1)\dotsc \phi(r_N)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This ansatz is too simple to work well in practice. A slightly more
sophisticated ansatz uses the notion of Slater determinants. The Slater
determinant is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi(x_1, x_2) &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{2\}\} [ \chi_1(x_1)\chi_2(x_2) - \chi_1(x_2)\chi_2(x_1)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

The full determinant for $N$ electrons is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{N!\}\}\begin\{vmatrix\}
    \chi_1(x_1) & \dotsc & \chi_N(x_1) \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \chi_1(x_N) & \dotsc & \chi_N(x_N)
    \end\{vmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Hartree-Fock method takes the ansatz that the $N$-body wave function
is given by a slater determinant. The method then performs a variational
approximation to find the best function in this class.

## Coupled Cluster

Coupled cluster methods are routinely viewed as the gold-standard for
classical quantum chemistry calculations and are often used to generate
training data to parameterize faster quantum chemistry techniques.

The wavefunction for the coupled-cluster method takes the exponential
ansatz

$$\begin\{aligned\}
| \psi \rangle &= e^T |\phi_0\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $\phi_0$ is a reference wave-function which is
given by a Slater determinant of orbitals as in Hartree-Fock. $T$ is
called the cluster operator and has the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
T &= T_1 + T_2 + \dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $T_1$ is the operator of single excitations, $T_2$
the operator of double excitations and so on. These operators are
formulated in terms of creation and annihilation operators.
