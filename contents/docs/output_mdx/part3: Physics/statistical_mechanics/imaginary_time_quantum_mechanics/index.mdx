[TODO: Cite Shankar]\{style="color: red"\} Quantum mechanics has built up
a rich body of mathematical techniques. Can we adapt these techniques to
solve problems in statistical mechanics? It turns out that a simple
mathematical transformation can do the trick $$\begin\{aligned\}
    t &= -i\tau
\end\{aligned\}$$ That is, we allow time to become a complex variable in
the equations of quantum mechanics rather than a real valued variable.
Applying this transformation to Schrodinger's equation, we get the
imaginary-time Schrodinger equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
-\hbar \frac\{d|\psi(\tau)\rangle\}\{d\tau\} &= H|\psi(\tau)\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ This operation is also commonly referred to as a
\"rotation\" to the imaginary axis ([TODO: Insert picture of the complex
plane.]\{style="color: red"\}) The propagator for this system is then
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(\tau) &= e^\{-\frac\{H\}\{\hbar\}\tau\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that the propagator is a Hermitian operator and not
a unitary operator. Let $|n\rangle$ be the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H|n\rangle &= E_n|n\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can expand the propagator in terms of these
eigenstates $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(\tau) &= \sum |n\rangle \langle n | e^\{-\frac\{1\}\{\hbar\}E_n\tau\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ For the case of the harmonic oscillator, we can simply
insert $t &= -i\tau$ in the closed form expression for the propagator to
obtain ([TODO: Flesh out the derivation]\{style="color: red"\})
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(x,x';\tau) &= \frac\{m\omega\}\{2\pi \hbar \sinh \omega \tau\} \exp \left [ -\frac\{m\omega\}\{2\hbar \sing \omega \tau\}((x^2 + x'^2)\cosh \omega \tau - 2xx' \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Heisenberg operators $\Omega(\tau)$ can then be
defined in terms of SChrodinger operator $\Omega$ ([TODO: Which
Schrodinger operator is this?]\{style="color: red"\}) $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \Omega(\tau) &= e^\{\frac\{H\}\{\hbar\} \tau\} \Omega e^\{-\frac\{H\}\{\hbar\} \tau\}
\end\{aligned\}$$
