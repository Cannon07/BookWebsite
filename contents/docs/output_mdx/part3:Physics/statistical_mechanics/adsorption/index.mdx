Adsorption occurs when atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or
dissolved solid become bound to a surface due to favorable interactions
(*e.g.* Van der Waal's forces), creating a film of the adsorbate on the
surface of the adsorbent. The term should not be confused with
*absorption*, in which a fluid (the absorbate) permeates or is dissolved
by a liquid or solid (the absorbent). Adsorption considers a
surface-based process, while the later involves the whole volume of the
material. The thermodynamic description of adsorption varies according
to the characteristics of the adsorbent. In this chapter we begin with a
study of non-interacting adsorption, ignoring the energy of interaction
between the adsorbed components. We consider two cases: mobile and
localized adsorption. We end by discuss phenomena arising from the
interaction between adsorbed molecules

## Non-interacting adsorption

We first address adsorption on a lattice where there is negligible
interaction between the adsorbed molecules.

Consider the following two scenarios for the surface adsorption
(Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}):

-   *Localized adsorption* occurs when the binding potential exhibits
    large spatial variations causing the adsorbate to be highly
    localized.

-   *Mobile adsorption* occurs when the surface potential is nearly
    homogeneous and the adsorbate is highly mobile.

In localized adsorption, each adsorbed molecule is trapped in a
potential well located at a specific lattice site. To a first
approximation, we can expand the potential in the $x$, $y$, and $z$
directions to quadratic order in the displacement. Thus, the
single-molecule partition function of an adsorbed molecule is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
q=q_xq_yq_ze^\{-\beta V_0\} \hspace\{0.4cm\} \text\{with\} \hspace\{0.4cm\} q_i = \frac\{e^\{-\theta _\{vib,i\}/(2T)\}\}\{1-e^\{-\theta _\{vib,i\}/(2T)\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $q_i(i =x,y,z)$ is a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator partition
function, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_\{vib,i\} = \frac\{\hslash \nu_i\}\{k_B\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is the vibrational temperature in the $i$ direction, and
$V_0$ is the potential at the well bottom.

Since each adsorbed molecule occupies a lattice site with a distinct
spatial location, they are distinguishable. For a lattice with $M$ sites
containing N adsorbed molecules, the degeneracy of configurations is
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Omega = \frac\{M!\}\{N!(M-N)!\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ and the canonical partition function for localized
adsorption is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
Q_\{localized\}(N,M,T) =\frac\{M!\}\{N!(M-N)!\}q^N
\end\{aligned\}$$

The chemical potential of the adsorbate is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\mu\}\{k_BT\} &= -\left( \frac\{\partial \log Q_\{localized\}\}\{\partial N\}\right)_\{M,T\} \\
&= -\log q + \log N -\log(M-N) \\
&= \log \left[ \frac\{\theta\}\{(1-\theta)q\} \right] \hspace\{0.3cm\} \text\{where\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \theta = \frac\{N\}\{M\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Assuming adsorption from the gas phase, equilibrium dictates equality of
the chemical potentials between the adsorbate on the surface and in the
gas phase. For an ideal gas, the chemical potential can be written as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\mu\}\{k_BT\} &= \frac\{\mu_0(T)\}\{k_BT\} + \log p
\end\{aligned\}$$ This leads to the *Langmuir adsorption isotherm*:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq4\}
\theta(p,T) = \frac\{\chi(T)p\}\{1+\chi(T)p\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \text\{where\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \chi(T) = q(T)e^\{\beta\mu_0(T)\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

that describes the surface coverage $\theta$ versus the temperature and
pressure of the gas-phase adsorbent for localized adsorption on a solid
adsorbent. The coverage tends to unity when $p \rightarrow \infty$
(total site coverage).

In the case of mobile adsorption, the single-molecule partition function
will have a $z$ direction contribution and an $xy$ contribution that
reflects surface mobility. This is constructed by assuming a 2D ideal
gas with a separate z component partition function, *i.e.*:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
q = \frac\{A\}\{\Lambda^2\}q_z^\{-\beta V_0\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \text\{where\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \Lambda = \sqrt\{\frac\{h^2\}\{2\pi m k_BT\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

and $A$ is the surface area of the adsorbent.

The mobile adsorbed molecules are indistinguishable, since they are not
restricted to a localized adsorption site. The canonical partition
function is therefore given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
Q_\{mobile\}(N,A,T) = \frac\{1\}\{N!\}q^N
\end\{aligned\}$$ This gives the chemical potential:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
\frac\{\mu\}\{k_BT\} = -\left( \frac\{\partial \log Q_\{mobile\}\}\{\partial N\}\right)_\{M,T\} = -\log q + \log N 
\end\{aligned\}$$

For adsorption from an ideal gas, the surface coverage is found to be:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
\log\left(\frac\{N\}\{q\} \right) = \log\left(pe^\{\beta \mu_0\} \right) \rightarrow \frac\{N\}\{A\} = \chi'(T)p
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $$\begin\{aligned\}
\chi'(T) &= \frac\{1\}\{\Lambda^2\}q_ze^\{-\beta V_0\}e^\{-\beta \mu_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

All things the same, this leads to $N_\{mobile\} > N_\{localized\}$ at all
pressures $p>0$ (Fig. [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig3"\}).

## Multi-component adsorption

This is easily extended to a system with $s$ component (localized
adsorption).

Define $q_i$ as the single-molecule partition function of the s
component, and $N_i$ as the number of adsorbed molecules of the $i$th
adsorbate (note, $N_\{tot\} = \sum_\{i=1\}^s N_i\leq N$). The degeneracy of
arranging $N_1,N_2,...,N_s$ adsorbed molecules on $M$ sites is
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Omega = \frac\{M!\}\{N_1!N_2!...N_s!(M - N_\{tot\})!\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The canonical partition function is given by:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
Q(N,M,T) = \frac\{M!\}\{N_1!N_2!...N_s!(M - N_\{tot\})!\} q_1^\{N_1\}q_2^\{N_2\}...q_s^\{N_s\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The chemical potential of the $i$th species is:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\mu_i\}\{k_BT\} &= -\left( \frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial N_i\}\right)_\{N_\{j \neq i\},M,T\} \notag\\
&= -\log q -\log(M-N_\{tot\}) + log N_i \notag\\
&= \log \left[ \frac\{N_i\}\{(M-N_\{tot\})q_i\} \right] \notag\\
&= \log \left[ \frac\{\theta_i\}\{(1-\sum_\{j=1\}^s \theta_j)q_i\} \right] \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

For equilibrium with an ideal gas phase, the chemical potential of the
$i$th species is written as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\mu_i\}\{k_BT\} &= \frac\{\mu_\{i,0\}(T)\}\{k_BT\} + \log p_i
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $p_i = py_i$ is the partial pressure of the $i$th
species ($y_i$ is the mole fraction in the gas phase).

Defining $$\begin\{aligned\}
\chi_i(T) &= q_ie^\{\beta \mu_\{i,0\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$, we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
p_i\chi_i = \frac\{\theta_i\}\{1 - \sum_\{j=1\}^s \theta_j\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \text\{where\} \hspace\{0.3cm\} \theta_i = \frac\{p_i\chi_i\}\{1 + \sum_\{j=1\}^s p_j\chi_j\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The two extremes of the multi-component isotherm are as follows: For
$p_i\chi_i \rightarrow 0$, the coverage behaves as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_i \approx p_i\chi_i
\end\{aligned\}$$ which is the Henry's law regime. For
$p_i\chi_i \rightarrow \infty$ while $p_j\chi_j$ remains finite
($i \neq j$), the coverage saturates to $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_i \rightarrow 1
\end\{aligned\}$$ Which is the complete coverage regime.

Therefore, binding affinity for a particular species can be outcompeted
by species with lower affinity by raising the partial pressure of the
other components

## Adsorption with interactions between adsorbed molecules

Our previous analysis neglects any interactions between adsorbed
molecules, which is an adequate description for low surface coverage and
lattice structure with large spacing. However, surface interactions
leads to correlated surface coverage, analogous to the spatial
correlations that we studied with the Ising model.

Let's adopt a simple model for the adsorption energy on a lattice:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq11\}
\beta E = f_\{bind\}\sum_\{i=1\}^M n_i - K \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\} n_in_j
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n_i$ is the site occupancy ($n_i = 0$ if unoccupied and $n_i = 1$
is occupied), $K$ is a coupling constant to describe interactions
between neighboring adsorbed molecules, and $f_\{bind\}$ is the free
energy of binding the adsorbed molecule (note,
$f_\{bind\} = -k_BT \log q$).

The grand canonical partition function is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\Xi = \sum_\{n_1,n_2,...n_M = 0,1\} \exp \left( \beta K \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\} n_in_j - \beta f_\{bind\}\sum_\{i=1\}^M n_i + \beta \mu\sum_\{i=1\}^M n_i \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Rather than analyze this further, let's convert this into a form that
demonstrates that this is exactly the Ising model that we have already
studied extensively. We relate the occupancy number $n_i$ to the spin
$s_i$ using $n_i = \frac\{s_i+1\}\{2\}$. which gives $n_i=1$ when $s_i=1$
and $n_0=0$ when $s_i=-1$. With this we write: $$\begin\{aligned\}
&\beta K \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\} n_in_j - \beta f_\{bind\}\sum_\{i=1\}^M n_i + \beta \mu\sum_\{i=1\}^M n_i = \\
&\frac\{\beta K\}\{4\} \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\} s_is_j + \beta \left(Kz + \frac\{\mu\}\{2\} - \frac\{f_\{bind\}\}\{2\}\right)\sum_\{i=1\}^M s_i + \beta M \left(\frac\{Kz\}\{4\}+\frac\{\mu\}\{2\} - \frac\{f_\{bind\}\}\{2\}\right) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $z$ is the coordination number of the lattice giving the number of
near neighbors divided by 2 to avoid double counting (*e.g.* $z = 2$ for
a 2D square lattice).

Therefore, we can exactly map our current problem onto the Ising model
with the parameters $J = K/4$ and $h = Kz+\mu/2- f_\{bind\}/2$, thus
leveraging the work that we have already done.

Owing to the exact mapping between our current problem and the Ising
model, identical physical phenomena arise in both systems

-   Adsorption with interactions exhibits a phase transition under some
    conditions (sufficiently large coupling constant $K$ and lattice
    that is not 1 dimensional).

-   Adsorption exhibits hysteresis in the surface coverage versus gas
    pressure associated with this phase transition.

-   The surface coverage is not completely uncorrelated; rather, the
    adsorbed molecules exhibit correlated fluctuations due to favorable
    interactions.

-   The critical point in the adsorption isotherm is associated with a
    divergence in the correlation length of these spatial fluctuations.

    and average occupation, where the average occupation of kind 'k' can
    be denoted as $\langle \sigma^\{k\}\rangle$.
