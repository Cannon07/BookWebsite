Turbulent flow, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exhibits
significant multi-scale behavior that critically makes direct simulation
difficult. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of fluid flow must resolve
the smallest scales of the flow, which are orders of magnitude smaller
than the characteristic dimensions of the flow. The computational cost
of direct simulation is high, making it impractical for applications
like vehicle aerodynamics, climate modeling, or astrophysics, and is
thus limited to simple flow configurations which are typically
oversimplified for general engineering or geophysical applications.

## The Reynolds Number

The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics
used to help predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations.
At low Reynolds numbers, fluid flow is dominated by laminar flow, while
at high Reynolds numbers fluid flow is turbulent, resulting from
differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may cross each
other or move in a direction opposite to the overall flow direction
leading to eddy currents.

The Reynolds number is calculated as the ratio of inertial forces to
viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal
movement due to different fluid velocities. Relative movement within a
fluid generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing
turbulent flow, while the viscosity of the fluid counteracts the effect
and inhibits turbulence. The Reynolds number quantifies the interplay
between these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and
provides a way to understand when turbulent flow will occur. A more
precise distinction between low Reynolds number flow and high Reynolds
number flow is that at low Reynolds numbers, viscous forces are
dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion, whereas
at high Reynolds numbers, turbulent flow occurs dominated by inertial
forces, which tend to produce eddies, vortices and other flow
instabilities. The Reynolds number is defined as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \mathrm \{Re\} =\{\frac \{\rho uD\}\{\mu \}\}=\{\frac \{uD\}\{\nu \}\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $u$ is the flow speed, $D$ is the diameter of the tube, $\mu$ is
the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\rho$ and $\nu$ are same quantities
as in the Navier Stokes equations.

### Turbulence Modeling

The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, which are
time-averaged equations of motion for fluid flow, are primarily used to
describe turbulent flows. The core idea behind the RANS equations is the
decomposition of an instantaneous quantity into its time-averaged and
fluctuating quantities, which was originally proposed by Osborne
Reynolds. For a stationary flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid,
these equations can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \rho \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{j\}\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{i\}\}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}=\rho \{\bar \{f\}\}_\{i\}+\{\frac \{\partial \}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}\left[-\{\bar \{p\}\}\delta _\{ij\}+\mu \left(\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{i\}\}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}+\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{j\}\}\{\partial x_\{i\}\}\}\right)-\rho \{\overline \{u_\{i\}^\{\prime \}u_\{j\}^\{\prime \}\}\}\right].\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where the time-average operator $\overline \{.\}$ is a Reynolds operator.
The left hand side of the RANS equation represents the change in mean
momentum of the fluid element due to the unsteadiness in the mean flow
and the convection by the mean flow. The change in mean momentum is
balanced by the mean body force, the isotropic stress owing to the mean
pressure field, the viscous stresses, and apparent stress
$\left(-\rho \{\overline \{u_\{i\}^\{\prime \}u_\{j\}^\{\prime \}\}\}\right)$ owing
to the fluctuating velocity field, generally referred to as the Reynolds
stress. The Reynolds stress is a non-linear term that requires
additional modeling to close the RANS equation for solving, and has led
to the creation of many different turbulence models.
