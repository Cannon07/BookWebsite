Classical fluids are systems of particles which retain a definite
volume, and are at sufficiently high temperatures that quantum effects
can be neglected. Most liquids at normal temperatures do satisfy this
condition, like liquid air, oil and gasoline, as well as electrolytes,
molten salts and salts dissolved in water, which are classified as
classical charged fluids.

In this chapter, we develop a simple model to describe the behavior of
classical fluids. Unlike ideal gases, whose energy states are purely
described by their kinetic energy, the existence of an interactive
potential in the case of liquids adds more complexity, as we now have to
consider the degree of correlation between fluctuations at different
positions. Thus, to determine the distribution function of the
correlations from different locations plays a central role in the
thermodynamic properties of classical liquids. This can be achieved by
x-ray scattering techniques, as we will review at the end of this
chapter.

## Classical Fluids

A system of molecules in fluid and solid phases includes all of the
particles that comprise the molecules, *i.e.* all protons, neutrons, and
electrons. This molecules are often accurately described in terms of the
principles of classical mechanics. The behavior of electrons surrounding
the nucleus indeed, would most likely be quantum mechanical in nature.
However in most cases, electron motion can be averaged over the quantal
fluctuations, leading to effective interactions between nuclei. For
example, the Lennard-Jones interaction potential is constructed to
include two offsetting physical contributions.

-   For short inter-nuclei spacing $r$, the Pauli exclusion principle
    dictates that the energy diverges exponentially as $r\rightarrow0$.
    This is approximated in the Lennard-Jones potential as $1/r^\{12\}$.

-   For large $r$, the electronic polarizability of the neutral atom
    leads to an attractive interaction that scales as $1/r^6$; such
    forces are called *Van der Waal's forces*.

The Lennard-Jones potential $V_\{LJ\}(r)$ is given by
(Fig.Â [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}):
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
V_\{LJ\}(r)=\nu_0\left[\left(\frac\{\sigma\}\{r\}\right)^\{12\} - \left(\frac\{\sigma\}\{r\}\right)^\{6\}\right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $r$ is the inter-nuclei spacing, $\nu_0$ is a potential scaling
term, and $s$ is a length scale of the interactions (related to the
polarizability of the atoms).

Generally, this procedure ignores the coupling between the electron and
nucleus kinetic energies; this approximation is valid in the limit
$m_e/M\rightarrow 0$ ($m_e \equiv$ electron mass and $M \equiv$ nuclear
mass). An important exception where a classical model of a fluid is not
acceptable is low temperature helium

Upon integrating over the electronic motion, we are left with a set of
effective particles that interact via an interaction potential, thus
defining a classical model for the interactions.

For an $N$ particle system, the classical degrees of freedom include the
coordinate positions $$\begin\{aligned\}
 \{\vec\{r\}\} = \vec\{r\}_1, \vec\{r\}_2,...,\vec\{r\}_N 
\end\{aligned\}$$ and momenta $$\begin\{aligned\}
 \{\vec\{p\}\} = \vec\{p\}_1, \vec\{p\}_2,...,\vec\{p\}_N 
\end\{aligned\}$$ thus, the microscopic state of the system is defined by
the point in phase space $\{ \vec\{p\}, \vec\{r\} \}$. For simplicity, we
will denote these terms respectively by $\vec\{p\}, \vec\{r\}$ when the
context is clear.

The thermodynamic behavior is governed by the partition function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
Q = \sum_\mu \exp\left(-\frac\{E_\mu\}\{k_BT\}\right) 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where the summation over $\mu$ implies a sum over
quantum states. The energy for a point in phase space is the Hamiltonian
$H$, *i.e.*: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
E_\mu \rightarrow H(\vec\{p\}, \vec\{r\}) = K(\vec\{p\}) + U(\vec\{r\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $$\begin\{aligned\}
K(\vec\{p\}) &= \sum_\{i=1\}^N\frac\{\vec\{p\}_i^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is the total kinetic energy, and $U(\vec\{r\})$ is the
effective classical interaction potential. Points in phase space form a
continuum, so the classical partition function must be:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Q &= A\int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2...d\vec\{r\}_N  \int d\vec\{p\}_1d\vec\{p\}_2...d\vec\{p\}_N   \exp\left[-\beta H(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\})\right] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $A$ is a factor to ensure that $Q$ is dimensionless. (Note that we
use the alternative style of writing the integral with integration
factors at the front rather than at the end for clarity. In general, we
will use the mathematical style for integrals with integration factors
at the end but may occasionally use the physics style for clarity of
expression.)

The factor $A$ corrects for the approximation that the phase space is a
continuum, thus $A$ is a universal parameter that does not depend on the
Hamiltonian $H$.

We find $A$ by considering the ideal gas Hamiltonian $H = K$, giving the
partition function: $$\begin\{aligned\}
Q &= AV^N\left[\int_\{-\infty\}^\infty  \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty  \exp \left(-\frac\{\beta\vec\{p\}^ 2\}\{2m\}\right) dp_z dp_y dp_x \right]^N\\
&= AV^N\left(\frac\{2\pi m\}\{\beta\}\right)^\{3N/2\} \\ 
&= \frac\{1\}\{N!\}\frac\{V^N\}\{\Lambda^\{3N\}\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where the final expression is taken from the translational partition
function of ideal gases , and considering that the particles are
indistinguishable. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\Lambda &= \sqrt\{\frac\{h^2\}\{2\pi mk_B T\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength.

Using this equality, we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
A &= \frac\{1\}\{N!\}\frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}\},
\end\{aligned\}$$ and the classical partition function is written as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Q &= \frac\{1\}\{N!h^\{3N\}\}\int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2...d\vec\{r\}_N \int d\vec\{p\}_1d\vec\{p\}_2...d\vec\{p\}_N \exp\left[-\beta H(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\})\right] \\ 
&= \frac\{1\}\{N!\Lambda^\{3N\}\}\int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2...d\vec\{r\}_N \exp[-\beta U(\vec\{r\})]  \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N!\}\frac\{1\}\{\Lambda^\{3N\}\}Z(T,V,N)  
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we define the configurational partition function $Z(T,V,N)$, thus
leaving only a configurational integral to perform.

The probability of finding the system at locations between $\{\vec\{r\}\}$
and $\{\vec\{r\} + d\vec\{r\}\}$ and momenta between $\{\vec\{p\}\}$ and
$\{\vec\{p\} + d\vec\{p\}\}$ system is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
f(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\})d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2...d\vec\{r\}_Nd\vec\{p\}_1d\vec\{p\}_2...d\vec\{p\}_N 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $f(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\})$ is the probability distribution for observing
a system at phase space point $\{\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\}\}$.

In this case, the probability distribution has the specific form
$$\begin\{aligned\}
f(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\}) = \frac\{1\}\{Qh^\{3N\}N!\}\exp[-\beta H(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\})] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Hamiltonian is $$\begin\{aligned\}
H(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\}) = K(\vec\{p\}) + U(\vec\{r\}),
\end\{aligned\}$$ thus we can represent the phase space distribution as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
f(\vec\{p\},\vec\{r\}) &= \frac\{1\}\{Qh^\{3N\}N!\}e^\{-\beta K(\vec\{p\})\}e^\{-\beta U(\vec\{r\})\} \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}N!\}\frac\{e^\{-\beta K(\vec\{p\})\}\}\{\int dp^Ne^\{-\beta K(\{ \vec\{p\}\})\}\}\frac\{e^\{\beta U(\vec\{r\})\}\}\{\int dr^Ne^\{\beta U(\vec\{r\})\}\} \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}N!\}\Phi(p^N)P(r^N)
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\Phi(p^N)$ and $P(r^N)$ define the probability distribution for
observing system at momentum space point $p^N$ and configuration space
point $r^N$, respectively.

We integrate the last expression over positions and momenta of particles
2 to N to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\int d\vec\{r\}^N \int d\vec\{p\}_j \prod_\{j=2\}^N f(\vec\{p\}, \vec\{r\})d\vec\{p\}_1 &= \frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}N!\} d\vec\{p\}_1 \int d\vec\{p\}_j \prod_\{j=2\}^N \Phi(p^N) \\ 
&=\frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}N!\} \phi(p_1) d\vec\{p\}_1 \prod_\{j=2\}^N \int d\vec\{p\}_j \phi(p_j) \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{h^\{3N\}N!\} \frac\{e^\{-\beta K(\vec\{p\}_1)\}\}\{\int d\vec\{p\}_1 e^\{-\beta K( \vec\{p\}_1)\}\} d\vec\{p\}_1 \\
&=(2\pi m k_B T)^\{3/2\} e^\{-\frac\{\vec\{p\}_1^2\}\{2mk_BT\}\}d\vec\{p\}_1
\end\{aligned\}$$

which is the Maxwell Distribution, that gives the probability that
particle 1 has momentum between $\vec\{p\}_1$ and
$\vec\{p\}_1 + d\vec\{p\}_1$.

We can rearrange the last expression, which originally considers the
differential over the three coordinates of $\vec\{p\}_1$, into a more
compact representation in spherical coordinates, such that
$d\vec\{p\}_1 = dp_\{x_1\}dp_\{y_1\}dp_\{z_1\} = p_1^2dp_1$. Additionally, if we
define the expression in terms of the velocity, we obtain a simpler form
of the Maxwell Distribution, giving the probability of finding a
particle with speed between $v$ and $v + dv$, given by:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq3\}
f(v)dv = 4\pi m^3 (2\pi mk_BT)^\{3/2\}\exp\left(-\frac\{m\}\{2k_BT\}v^2\right)v^2dv
\end\{aligned\}$$

The most probable speed is $\nu^*= \sqrt\{2k_BT/m\}$.

## *Equipartition Theorem*

The equipartition theorem dictates that each thermally active degree of
freedom is partitioned a fixed energy.

Assume the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized into $m$ degree of freedom
using a general coordinate system $\{q\} = q_1,q_2,...,q_m$, *e.g.* the
phonon modes in a crystal, giving the Hamiltonian:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq4\}
H = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^na_ip_i^2 + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{j=1\}^mb_jq_j^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using the partition function, we can write the average:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle a_i p_i^2\rangle = \frac\{\int_\{-\infty\}^\infty a_ip_i^2e^\{-\frac\{1\}\{2\}\beta a_ip_i^2\}dp_i\}\{\int_\{-\infty\}^\infty e^\{-\frac\{1\}\{2\}\beta a_ip_i^2\}dp_i\} = \frac\{1\}\{2\}k_BT 
\end\{aligned\}$$

with a similar expression giving
$\langle b_jq_j^2\rangle = \frac\{1\}\{2\}k_BT$.

Thus, the average energy is
$\langle E \rangle = \langle H \rangle = \frac\{1\}\{2\}nk_BT + \frac\{1\}\{2\}mk_BT$.
For a monoatomic gas, $m=0$ and $n=3N$ ($N$ particles and 3 directions),
giving $\langle E\rangle = \frac\{3\}\{2\}Nk_BT$. For vibration in a solid,
$m=3N$ and $n=3N$, giving $\langle E \rangle = 3Nk_BT$.

## Pair distribution function

The configurational distribution $P(r^N)$, cannot be factored into
single partition functions, as we did with $\Phi(p^N)$ above, because
the potential energy $U(\vec\{r\})$, couples together all of the
coordinates. However, we can analyze the distribution function for a
small number of particles by integrating over all coordinates except
those corresponding to the particles of interest. For example, define
the reduced probability distribution for a pair of particles:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
p^\{2,N\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) = \frac\{1\}\{Z\}\int d\vec\{r\}_3\int d\vec\{r\}_4\dotsc \int
d\vec\{r\}_N\exp[-\beta U(\vec\{r\})] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

giving the joint probability of finding particle 1 at $\vec\{r\}_1$ and
particle 2 at $\vec\{r\}_2$.

Since we don't care about the particle identity, the joint probability
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) &= N(N-1)p^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2),
\end\{aligned\}$$ giving the probability for finding any one particle at
$\vec\{r\}_1$ and any other particle at $\vec\{r\}_2$. Generally, we can
write the $n$-particle joint probability as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho^\{(n,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2,\dotsc,\vec\{r\}_n) = \frac\{N!\}\{(N-n)!\}\frac\{1\}\{Z\}\int\prod_\{i=n+1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_i\exp [-\beta U(\vec\{r\})] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

For an isotropic fluid,

$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \rho^\{(1,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1) = \frac\{N\}\{V\} = \rho
\end\{aligned\}$$

For a non-interacting system (ideal gas): $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) &= \rho^\{(1,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1)\rho^\{(1,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_2)\\
&= \frac\{N(N-1)\}\{V^2\} \approx \frac\{N^2\}\{V^2\} = \rho^2 
\end\{aligned\}$$

To measure correlations, define the pair distribution function:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
g(\vec\{r_1\},\vec\{r_2\}) = \frac\{\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2)\}\{\rho^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The fractional deviation from ideal gas approximation is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
h(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2)=g(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) - 1
\end\{aligned\}$$

For an isotropic fluid the pair distribution function only depends on
$|\vec\{r\}_1 -\vec\{r\}_2| = r$, thus $g(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) = g(r)$ and
$h(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2) = h(r)$.

The pair distribution function gives $\rho g(r)$, the average density of
particles at a distance $r$ given that a tagged particle is at the
origin (Fig.Â [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}).

## *Measurement of $g(r)$ by diffraction*

Consider a collection of $N$ particles in a fluid. To probe distances
$\sim 1\AA$, irradiate the sample with X-rays or neutrons; our
discussion will assume X-ray scattering. A beam with wavelength
$\lambda$ illuminates the sample. The incident beam is coherent, *i.e.*
all photons are in-phase (Fig.Â [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig3"\}). Due to a difference between the refractive index of
the particles and their surroundings, each particle acts as a scattering
center

Compare the pathlengths for scattering from 2 different particles
(Fig.Â [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}). The
position of the $i$th and $j$th particles are located at $\vec\{r\}_i$ and
$\vec\{r\}_j$, respectively. The difference in the pathlength of the 2
photons in Fig.Â [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}
is given by the difference between lengths $B$ and $A$, since these are
the only segments that differ between the two photons.

Define the incident wavevector: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
\vec\{q\}_0 = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction of the solution, and $\vec\{u\}_0$ is
a unit vector that defines the direction of the incident light.
Similarly, define the scattered wavevector:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
\vec\{q\}_s = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_s
\end\{aligned\}$$

The fixed detector orientation relative to the source is defined by the
angle $\theta$.

Using these definitions, the two lengths $B$ and $A$ are given:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
B = (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_s
\end\{aligned\}$$

::: marginfigure
:::

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
A = (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The pathlength difference is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq11\}
B - A = (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot (\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This results in a phase difference given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq12\}
\phi_\{ij\} = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(B - A) = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0) \cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the scattering vector $\vec\{q\}$ as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq13\}
\vec\{q\} = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

whose magnitude is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq14\}
q = |\vec\{q\}| = \frac\{4\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\sin\left(\frac\{\theta\}\{2\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

We have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{15\}
\phi_\{ij\} = \vec\{q\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The electric field of light scattered by the $i$th particle relative to
the phase of light scattered by the $k$th particle is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq16\}
E_i = E_0C \cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi _\{ik\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the frequency, $E_0$ is the amplitude of the incident
electric field, and $C$ incorporates a number of experiment-specific
parameters (*e.g.* distance to detector, wavelength, polarizability).
The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the total
electric field squared. The average scattering intensity $I_s$ is given
by the intensity averaged over a complete oscillation period and is
given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq17\}
I_s &= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt\left[ \sum_\{i=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}) \right]^2 \\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\})\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{jk\}) \\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N[\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\}) + \cos(\phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

which makes use of the property:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq18\}
\cos A \cos B = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos(A + B) + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos (A- B)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Noting that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq19\}
\int_0^\{1/\nu\}\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\}) dt =0
\end\{aligned\}$$

and, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq20\}
\phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\} = \phi_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

we have, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
I_s &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos\phi_\{ij\} \\
 &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Measuring $I_s$ at zero scattering angle ($\theta = 0$) gives the
unknown parameters $I_0$ and $A$. Therefore,

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq22\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the structure factor $S(\vec\{k\})$ to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq23\}
S(\vec\{k\}) = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N \bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j) \right] \bigg\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

we can write:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq24\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = Re[S(\vec\{q\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Rotational invariance gives $S(\vec\{k\}) = S(-\vec\{k\})$, thus:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq25\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = S(\vec\{q\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Expand the structure factor into $i = j$ and $i \neq j$. This gives:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
S(\vec\{k\}) & = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N(N-1)\bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2) \right] \bigg\rangle \\
& = \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\frac\{N(N-1)\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\}e^\{-\beta U\}\}\{\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{-\beta U\}\}\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\} \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\rho^2g(r_\{12\})e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\} \\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N\}\rho \int d\vec\{r\}g(r)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}\} \\
&= N^\{-1\} + N^\{-1\}\rho\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\})$ is the Fourier transform of $g(\vec\{k\})$.
This demonstrates that the results of a scattering experiment give a
direct measure of the pair distribution of the particles in the fluid.
