In this chapter, we will study the behavior of plasmas, one of the
fundamental states of matter. Plasmas, are gases of ions and free
electrons. Plasmas arise in a number of physical systems of interest,
such as stars and lightning, and are also of critical interest for
industrial processes such as chip manufacturing and fusion.

## Qualitative Properties of Plasma

Plasmas are electrically conducting since they consist of a gas of
ionized particles. As a result, the techniques of fluid mechanics
combined with those of electromagnetism prove powerful tools for
modeling plasma behavior.

The degree of ionization $\alpha$ is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\alpha = \frac\{n_i\}\{n_i + n_n\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n_i$ is the number density of ions and $n_n$ is the number
density of neutral atoms.

## Magnetohydrodynamics

Magnetohydrodynamics is one of the standard techniques for
mathematically modelling plasmas. This model combines elements of the
Navier-Stokes equations with Maxwell's equations to create a continuum
model of the plasma as a type of electrically charged fluid.

In this section, we will introduce the core equations of
magnetohydrodynamics. Let's start with a continuity equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial \rho\}\{\partial t\} + \nabla \cdot (\rho v) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Cauchy momentum equation is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho \left ( \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} + v \cdot \nabla  \right ) v &= J \times B - \nabla p 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using the identity

$$\frac\{1\}\{2\} \nabla (B \cdot B) = (B \cdot \nabla) B + B \times (\nabla \times B)$$

### Magnetohydrodynamic Waves

## Vlasov Equation

An alternative model of plasmas is to model them as a large collection
of individual particles moving in the presence of an electromagnetic
field.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d f(r, p, t)\}\{dt\} &= 0 \\
    \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial t\} + \frac\{d r\}\{d t\} \cdot \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial r\} + \frac\{d p\}\{d t\}\cdot \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial p\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Vlasov equations add a self-consistent field created by the charged
plasma particles. The theory introduces two distribution functions

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f_e(r, p, t) &= 0 \\
    f_i(r, p , t) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ that model the density of electrons and positive ions
respectively. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial f_e\}\{\partial t\}+ v_e \cdot \nabla f_e - e \left (E + \frac\{v_e\}\{c\} \times B \right) \cdot \frac\{\partial f_e\}\{\partial p\} &= 0 \\
    \frac\{\partial f_i\}\{\partial t\}+ v_i \cdot \nabla f_i - Z_i e \left (E + \frac\{v_i\}\{c\} \times B \right) \cdot \frac\{\partial f_i\}\{\partial p\} &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $E$ and $B$ are the self consistent electrical and
magnetic fields created by the system.

## Plasma Confinement

Since plasmas are electrically charged, it becomes possible to confine
them with magnetic fields. This property of plasmas is very useful for
building prototype fusion reactors which need to confine high
temperature plasmas to facilitate conditions for fusion.
