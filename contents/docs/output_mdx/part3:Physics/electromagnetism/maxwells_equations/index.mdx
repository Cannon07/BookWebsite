Maxwell's equations are a collection of coupled partial differential
equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields to one another.

Let the electric and magnetic fields be given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
E: &\mathbb\{R\}^3 \to T \mathbb\{R\}^3 \\
B: &\mathbb\{R\}^3 \to T \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let $\rho: \mathbb\{R\}^3 \to \mathbb\{R\}$ be a charge
density function which tracks the continuous amount of charge at a given
location.

Maxwell's laws are defined by four equations that we discuss in the
following sections. The four equations are coupled to one another and
jointly define the electrical and magnetic fields as a set of 4 coupled
PDEs.

## Gauss's Law

Gauss's law dictates how a given charge distribution induces an electric
field. We state the law below in its differential form.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla \cdot E = \frac\{\rho\}\{\epsilon_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Gauss's law can be viewed as a statement that the electric charge
contained within a region of space induces a \"flow\" outwards of the
electric field as measured by the divergence of the electric field.

If the electric field is given by a potential, Gauss's law turns into
Poisson's equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla^2 V &= - \frac\{\rho\}\{\varepsilon_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Gauss's Law for Magnetism

Gauss's law for magnetism stands in contrast to Gauss's law. There is no
concept of a \"magnetic charge\" that induces an outward flow in the
magnetic field. In fact, the magnetic field must always have divergence
0. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla \cdot B = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Faraday's Law of Induction

The two versions of Gauss's law have treated the electric and magnetic
fields in isolation. Faraday's law describes how a time varying magnetic
field induces an electric field. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla \times E = - \frac\{\partial B\}\{\partial t\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Ampère's Law

Ampère's law describes how both electric current and a time varying
electric field induce a magnetic field $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla \times B = \mu_0 \left (J + \epsilon_0 \frac\{\partial E\}\{\partial t\} \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

## A Physical Theory for Maxwell's Equations

In this section, we transform Maxwell's laws into a physical theory in
our formulation. The state space is given by a tuple for the electric
and magnetic fields $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{S\} &= (\mathbb\{R\}^3 \to T\mathbb\{R\}^3)^2 \\
(E, B) &\in \mathcal\{S\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The state is the pair of the current electric and
magnetic fields $(E, B)$. We define the electromagnetic energy density
as $$\begin\{aligned\}
U = \frac\{\epsilon_0 \|E\|^2\}\{2\} + \frac\{\|B\|^2\}\{2 \mu_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ and the energy flux $u$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
u &= \frac\{E \times B\}\{\mu_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The energy density obeys the conservation equation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial t\} + \nabla \cdot u &= - E \cdot J
\end\{aligned\}$$

The evolution of the system is governed by the solution to Maxwell's
equations. The parameters of the theory are given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{W\} &= \{E_0, B_0, \epsilon_0, \mu_0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are the initial electric and
magnetic fields. The domain of applicability $\mathcal\{C\}$ is governed
by the fact that the magnitude of the fields shouldn't get too large

$$\begin\{aligned\}
|E_0|, |B_0| < C
\end\{aligned\}$$

The hyperparameters are given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\mathcal\{HP\} = \{C, \epsilon \}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The observables $\mathcal\{B\}$ are defined as follows. Using a test
charge we can measure the electric and magnetic field strengths at a
point up to some noise $$\begin\{aligned\}
f(E, B, x) = (E(x) + \textrm\{Normal\}(0, \epsilon), B(x) + \textrm\{Normal\}(0, \epsilon))
\end\{aligned\}$$

## A Lagrangian for Maxwell's Equations

Let's now introduce a Lagrangian view of this system. Let's start with a
few definitions. Let $E$ be an electric field. Let $B$ be a magnetic
field. The magnetic vector potential is defined as the solution to the
following equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    B &= \nabla \times A
\end\{aligned\}$$ The scalar potential $\phi(\vec\{r\}, t)$ is then defined
as the solution to the following equation. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    E(\vec\{r\}, t)  &= - \nabla \phi - \frac\{\partial A\}\{\partial t\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The minimal coupling Lagrangian of a charged particle with mass $m$ and
charge $q$ is defined as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    L = \frac\{1\}\{2\} m \vec\{v\}^T\vec\{v\} + q \vec\{v\}^TA - q \phi 
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\vec\{v\} = \frac\{d \vec\{r\}\}\{dt\}$ is the velocity
