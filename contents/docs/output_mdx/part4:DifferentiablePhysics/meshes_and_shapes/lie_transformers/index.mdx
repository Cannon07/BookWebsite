Equivariant architectures are often constructed to be equivariant to
given groups such as the Euclidean group or the Lorentz group. However,
it is possible to construct architectures that are equivariant to any
given Lie group. This methodology depends on exploiting the structure of
the group exponential and logarithm maps
[@hutchinson2021lietransformer], [@finzi2020generalizing]. There is
often an efficiency loss from the general construction, but there is a
powerful gain in generality and ease of experimentation.
