The quantum fields we have considered till now have all been free,
without interactions. In this chapter, we will study the basics of how
to study interacting field theory. Mathematically, interacting field
theory is considerably more complex than free field theory since the
product of operator valued distributions is not defined in general.

## Dyson's Formula

Suppose that we have a Hamiltonian split into a free part and an
interaction part $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= H_0 + V_S(t)
\end\{aligned\}$$ The interaction picture of quantum mechanics defines the
quantity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    V_I(t) &= e^\{iH_0(t-t_0)\}V_S(t)e^\{-iH_0(t-t_0)\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Suppose we write the update operator as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t) &= U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This operator is called the Dyson operator. This
operator satisfies a few properties

-   Identity $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U(t, t) &= I
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Composition $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U(t, t_0) &= U(t, t_1) U(t_1, t_0)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Time Reversal $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U^\{-1\}(t, t_0) &= U(t_0, t)
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   Unitarity $$\begin\{aligned\}
            U^\dagger(t, t_0) U(t, t_0) &= 1
        
    \end\{aligned\}$$

We state but don't prove the fact that these properties imply the
following $$\begin\{aligned\}
    i\frac\{d\}\{dt\}U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0) &= V(t)U(t, t_0) \psi(t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This defines an integral equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= 1 - i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) U(t_1, t_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$ This equation can be iterated to solve $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= 1 - i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) U(t_1, t_0) \\
    &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1)\left (1 - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} V(t_2)U(t_2, t_0) \right ) \\
     &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_2\} V(t_1)V(t_2)U(t_2, t_0)  \\
    %&= \dotsc \\
    &= 1 -i\int_\{t_0\}^t V(t_1) - i \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_2\} V(t_1)V(t_2) - \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\}\int^\{t_2\}_\{t_0\} \int^\{t_3\}_\{t_0\} V(t_1)V(t_2)V(t_3) + \dotsc 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note the condition we have that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    t_1 > t_2 > \dotsc > t_n
\end\{aligned\}$$ We define the time ordering operator which reorders its
arguments to be in descending time order. Now let us define the terms
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    U_n &= (-i)^n \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_1\} \dotsc \int_\{t_0\}^\{t_n\} \mathcal\{T\} V(t_1)\dotsc V(t_n)
\end\{aligned\}$$ By noting the symmetry of the system, we can simplify
the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U_n &= \frac\{(-i)^n\}\{n!\} \int_\{t_0\}^t \dotsc \int_\{t_0\}^t \mathcal\{T\} V(t_1)\dotsc V(T_n)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We now have the expansion $$\begin\{aligned\}
    U(t, t_0) &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty U_n \\
    &= \mathcal\{T\} \exp \left ( -i \int_\{t_0\}^t V(\tau) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is typically referred to as Dyson's Formula.

## The $S$-Matrix

We define the $S$-matrix by the formula $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= \lim_\{t_2 \to \infty\} \lim_\{t_1 \to -\infty\} U(t_2, t_1)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using Dyson's formula, we can write the $S$-matrix as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    S &= \mathcal\{T\} \exp \left ( -i \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty V(\tau) \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us call the $n$-th term of the exponential's Taylor
expansion $S_n$. The Feynman diagrams can be viewed as constituent terms
in $S_n$

## Perturbative Expansion of Correlation Functions

In this section we will introduce perturbation theory for quantum
fields. In particular, we will compute the quantity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle \Omega | \mathcal\{T\}\phi(x)\phi(y) | \Omega \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ for the $\phi^4$ interacting theory. Note that this is
the simplest theory which isn't directly solvable as a Gaussian
integral. Here $|\Omega\rangle$ is the ground state of the interacting
theory. Recall that for the free theory, the same interaction function
is simply given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle 0 | \mathcal\{T\} \phi(x) \phi(y) | 0 \rangle_\{\textrm\{free\}\} &= D_F(x-y) \\
    &= \int \frac\{d^4p\}\{(2\pi)^4\}\frac\{ie^\{-ip\cdot(x-y)\}\}\{p^2-m^2+i\epsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Recall that this is an equality of distributions and not
of functions.

The Hamiltonian for the $\phi^4$ theory is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    H &= H_0 + H_\{\textrm\{int\}\} \\
    &= H_\{\textrm\{Klein-Gordon\}\} + \int d^3 x \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\} \phi^4(x) 
\end\{aligned\}$$ The basic strategy in perturbation theory is to
construct a power series for the correlation function in terms of
parameter $\lambda$.

## $\varphi^4$-Theory

The simplest interacting field theory that we will consider is
$\varphi^4$-theory which adds a quartic interaction term to the
Klein-Gordon Lagrangian

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{L\}(\varphi) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\}[\partial^\mu \varphi \partial \varphi - m^2 \varphi^2] - \frac\{\lambda\}\{4!\}\varphi^4
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Higher Order Interaction Terms

We can use Wick's theorem to reduce higher order interaction terms to
pairwise interaction terms.
