Previously in physical theories we consiered, we limited the range of
speeds addressable by a physical theory, blaming relativistic effects.
What precisely is a relativistic effect? Broadly, relativity addresses
the problem of changing reference frames correctly in physics.

Here, a reference frame is a point in spacetime (typically modeled as
$\mathbb\{R\}^4$) and denoted by $$\begin\{aligned\}
(t, x, y, z) \in \mathbb\{R\}^4
\end\{aligned\}$$ By convention, the first parameter denotes the time, and
the remaining parameters the spatial coordinates. Each reference frame
is also attached to a basis for $\mathbb\{R\}^4$ called a coordinate
system.

You can think of the reference frame and coordinate system as hidden
parameters in all the models we've dealt with so far. Often, it is
useful to switch between two reference frames. Let's consider an example
of a change of reference frame in Figure
[1.1](#fig:standard_conf)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:standard_conf"\}.

This figure corresponds to the transformation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    x' &= x - vt \\
    y' &= y \\
    z' &= z \\
    t' &= t
\end\{aligned\}$$ This type of transformation is typically called a
uniform motion. In this case, the uniform motion is purely in the $x$
coordinate direction. There are in general 3 types of transformations
allowed in classical physics.

-   Uniform Motion: A uniform motion with velocity
    $\vec\{v\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ performs the the transformation.
    $$(\vec\{x\}, t) \to (\vec\{x\}+t\vec\{v\}, t)$$

-   Translation: A translation is given by position shift
    $\vec\{a\} \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ and time shift $s \in \mathbb\{R\}$ and
    performs the transformation
    $$(\vec\{x\}, t) \to (\vec\{x\} + \vec\{a\}, t + s)$$

-   Rotation: A rotation is given by an orthogonal matrix
    $G: \mathbb\{R\}^3 \to \mathbb\{R\}^3$ and performs the transformation
    $$(\vec\{x\}, t) \to (G\vec\{x\}, t)$$

## Galilean Transformations

Galilean transformations are the set of transformations which can be
written as the compositions of uniform motions, translations, and
rotations.

The collection of Galilean transformations forms a mathematical group.
You will show that this group is a Lie group of dimension 10 in the
exercises.

## Lorentzian Transformations

One of the great discoveries in physics was Einstein's realization that
Galilean transformations were not sufficient to describe physical
phenomena at high speeds. It turned out that a more general class of
transformations, called Lorentz transformations were needed for this.

The Lorentz group $\mathcal\{L\}$ is the set of transformations $O(3, 1)$
that leave the Minkowski metric of a 4-vector unchanged. A Lorentz boost
is one such transformation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    x' &= \gamma(x - vt) \\
    y' &= y \\
    z' &= z \\
    t' &= \gamma \left ( t - \frac\{vx\}\{c^2\} \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
\gamma &= \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{1 - \frac\{v^2\}\{c^2\}\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Note that in the case that $v \ll c$, we have that $\gamma \approx 1$,
in which case the Lorentzian transformation reduces to a Galilean
transformation. Similar transformations can be defined in the $y$ and
$z$ directions as well. In general, it is possible to define a
Lorentzian boost in an arbitrary direction $n$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    t' &= \gamma \left ( t - \frac\{v n \cdot r\}\{c^2\} \right ) \\
    r' &= r + (\gamma - 1)(r \cdot n)n - \gamma t v n
\end\{aligned\}$$
