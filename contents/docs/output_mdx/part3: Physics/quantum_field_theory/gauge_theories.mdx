Gauge theories arise in quantum field theories that obey a local
symmetry that is position dependent. In this chapter, we introduce the
basics of gauge theories.

## The XY Model

The XY model provides a toy example of a gauge theory. This model is an
example of what is called a *nonlinear sigma model* and involves a
$O(N)$ isovector $n$ with unit length which has the $O(N)$ invariant
interaction

$$\begin\{aligned\}
Z(K) = \int \prod_r dn(r) \exp \Bigg [ K \sum_\{\langle r, r' \rangle\} n(r) \cdot n(r') \Bigg ], \qquad |n| = 1
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\langle r, r' \rangle$ means that $r$, $r'$ are nearest neighbors
in a lattice. We can write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    n(r) = i \cos \theta(r) + j \sin \theta(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we assume that we operate in two dimensions. We
define the correlation function

$$\begin\{aligned\}
G_\{\alpha\beta\}(r - r') &= \langle e^\{i\alpha \theta(r)\} e^\{i\beta \theta(r')\} \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

The invariance that this theory satisfies is $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta(r) \mapsto \mathcal\{S\}(\theta(r)) = \theta(r) + \theta_0, \quad \forall r
\end\{aligned\}$$

## $\mathcal\{Z\}_2$ Gauge theory in two dimensions

Consider a square lattice.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z(K) = \sum_s \Bigg [ K \sum_\{\square\} s_i s_j s_k s_l \Bigg ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $\square$ denotes squares in the lattice. Ising
variables are placed on bonds in the lattice. Note that reversing all
spins

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    s_i \mapsto -s_i
\end\{aligned\}$$ preserves the model. Note that this model also satisfies
a local symmetry when we only flip the spins $B(r)$ that adjoin the
lattice point. This means that products of spins around closed loops
will survive the gauge transformation (since 2 or 0 will flip).
