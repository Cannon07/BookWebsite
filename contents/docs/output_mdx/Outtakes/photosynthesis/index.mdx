In this chapter we discuss the interactions of a radiation field with a
photochemical system which absorbs radiation over a broad band of
frequencies. Of primary concern are the evaluation of the chemical
potential difference which is developed within the system, and the
amount of work, *i.e.* free energy, which may appear as a result of
light absorption by such a system.

## Light Absorption Induced Excitations

Consider a two-level photochemical system which consists of a collection
of ground electronic states $G$ and excited electronic states $E$
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}). In
systems where excitations can migrate easily, these collections of
states are often referred to as the *valence band* and the *conduction
band*, respectively. Each electronic band usually contains a number of
vibrational substates.

When the rate of absorption of light quanta causing excitations from $G$
to $E$ is rapid with respect to the thermal equilibration of populations
between the two bands, then a transition from $E$ to $G$ gives up some
free energy which may be stored or used for chemical synthesis. The
amount of work which can be done as a result of the absorption of each
photon is limited by the product of this free-energy change $\mu$, and
the quantum yield for the de-excitation pathway which is coupled to work
production.

If the sub states within each electronic band remain in thermal
equilibrium regardless of the incident radiation field, then the
potential difference between any substate of $G$ and any substate of $E$
will be independent of the identity of either substate. In other words,
there will be a single well-defined free-energy change for any
transition between the bands.

There are two ways of viewing the excitations caused by the absorption
of light:

-   *Photoelectric view*. Excitation may be considered as producing an
    increase in the population of electrons in a set of states of fixed
    number, with a corresponding decrease in the population of electrons
    in another set of states of fixed number. Adequate if the system
    operates through electron migration.

-   *Photochemical view* Excitation may be considered as producing as an
    increase the number of an excited state molecular species and a
    concomitant decrease in the number of a ground state molecular
    species. Adequate if light absorption is molecular rearrangement.

In this lecture we will consider a *photochemical view*, *i.e.* we
analyze changes in the partial molar free energy of the light-absorbing
molecules in their ground state and in their excited state. The action
of light usually depletes the population of the ground-state molecules
only very slightly, altering the chemical activity of these species to a
negligible extent; in this case the potential difference arising between
the bands is due almost entirely to the greatly increased population of
molecules in the excited state.

## Chemical Potential of Photochemical Systems

In order to evaluate the band-to-band potential difference $\mu$ caused
by a radiation field in any given situation, we first consider the
conditions for equilibrium between the band-to-band transitions and a
radiation field. Reversible reaction implies that there is no change in
entropy accompanying the emission or absorption of radiation by the
photochemical system at any frequency.

The entropy change corresponding to the loss of a photon of frequency
$\nu$ from a radiation field may be evaluated by considering an
equilibrium at $\nu$ between the field and a blackbody. A blackbody is
in equilibrium with a radiation field at $\nu$ when: $$\label\{Eq1\}
I(\nu) = \frac\{8\pi n^2\nu^2\}\{c^2\}\frac\{1\}\{e^\{h\nu/k_BT_B\}-1\}$$

where $T_B$ is the temperature of the blackbody, $n$ is the refractive
index of the medium, and $I$ is the intensity of the radiation field in
units of photons per $4\pi$ solid angle, per unit bandwidth, per unit
area, per unit time.

The entropy gained by a blackbody upon absorption of a photon at $\nu$
is $h\nu/T$. By rearranging ([\[Eq1\]](#Eq1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq1"\}) to find the temperature of a blackbody in equilibrium
with a radiation field of intensity $I$, we find the entropy change upon
loss of a photon from a radiation field of the photochemical system, to
be: $$\label\{Eq2\}
-\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial N\} = k\ln\left( 1+  \frac\{8\pi n^2\nu^2\}\{c^2I\}\right)$$

Assuming a canonical ensemble $T,V,N$, we can define a relation between
the potential difference $\mu$ and the change in entropy per photon
absorbed by the photochemical system as: $$\label\{Eq3\}
 \frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial N\} = \frac\{h\nu - \mu\}\{T\}$$ If we assume
that the photochemical absorber is isotropic in its interaction with a
radiation field, we can assume that the entropy change induced by photon
absorbed is equal to the negative of the entropy change due to emission
of a photon. Then by integrating over solid angle, and equating the
entropies, we find that the rate of photon absorption and emission per
unit bandwidth and unit cross section is: $$\label\{photonEm\}
I(\nu,\mu,T) = 8\pi\left(\frac\{n\nu\}\{c\}\right)^2\frac\{1\}\{e^\{(h\nu-\mu)/k_BT\}-1\}$$

where we consider the loss due entropy of photon emitted as
$-\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial N\}$, due to reversibility.

The number one in ([\[photonEm\]](#photonEm)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="photonEm"\}) corresponds to stimulated emission, which may
usually be neglected simplifying the expression to get: $$\label\{Eq4\}
I(\nu,\mu,T) = 8\pi\left(\frac\{n\nu\}\{c\}\right)^2\exp\left(\frac\{\mu-h\nu\}\{k_BT\}\right)$$

If the absorption cross section for band-to-band excitation is
$\sigma(\nu,\mu,T)$, then the total rate of excitation and emission per
unit bandwidth is equal to $$\label\{Eq5\}
\sigma(\nu,\mu,T) \times I(\nu,\mu,T)$$ for a photochemical system which
has thermal equilibrium at temperature T within its electronic bands,
and a potential difference $\mu$ between the bands, and which is in
equilibrium with an isotropic radiation field at all frequencies.

For simplicity we assume that the absorption spectrum is independent of
$\mu$, although this may not be true. Changes with temperature can be
ignored since $T$ is assumed to be fixed. Then, by adding the absorption
cross section for band-to-band excitation $\sigma(\nu)$ to the frequency
dependent factors of ([\[Eq4\]](#Eq4)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq4"\}), we find that the emission spectrum as a function of
$\nu$ is given by (Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig2"\}): $$\label\{Eq6\}
\sigma(\nu)n^2(\nu)\nu^2\exp\left(-\frac\{h\nu\}\{k_BT\} \right)$$

The Planck-law relationship between absorption and emission may be used
to calculate the potential developed in a photochemical system whenever
its absorption spectrum and the incident light flux are known.

The rate of band-to-band excitations resulting from an arbitrary
radiative field is equal to:

$$\label\{Eq7\}
R_\{in\} = \int \sigma(\nu)I_S(\nu)d\nu$$

From ([\[Eq6\]](#Eq6)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq6"\}) the rate of
radiative decay from a photochemical system having a potential
difference $\mu$ is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
R_\{lum\} &= \exp\left(-\frac\{h\mu\}\{k_BT\} \right) \int 8\pi\left(\frac\{n\nu\}\{c\}\right)^2\sigma(\nu)\exp\left(-\frac\{h\nu\}\{k_BT\}\right)d\nu \notag\\
&=\exp\left(-\frac\{h\mu\}\{k_BT\} \right)L
\end\{aligned\}$$ where we abbreviate the integral with $L$.

By equating ([\[Eq7\]](#Eq7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq7"\}) and
([\[Eq8\]](#Eq8)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq8"\}), we can find the
maximum possible potential of a photochemical system having an
absorption spectrum $\sigma(\nu)$, and illuminated by a radiation field
of intensity and distribution $I_S(\nu)$: $$\label\{Eq9\}
\mu_\{max\}=k_BT\ln\left( \frac\{R_\{in\}\}\{L\}\right)$$

Nonradiative band-to-band transitions are frequently a significant
source of $E$-to-$G$ relaxation. We assume that the rate of induced
$G$-to-$E$ transitions given by ([\[Eq7\]](#Eq7)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq7"\}) is large with respect to all spontaneous excitations.
Then we specify that the total rate of decay from $E$ to $G$ is $\kappa$
times the rate of radiative decay alone: $$\label\{Eq10\}
R_\{out\}=\kappa(\mu)L\exp\left( \frac\{\mu\}\{k_BT\} \right)$$

By equating $R_\{in\}$ and $R_\{out\}$ we determine the potential developed
in the presence of nonradiative relaxation:: $$\label\{Eq11\}
\mu = k_BT\ln\left( \frac\{R_\{in\}\}\{\kappa(\mu)L\} \right) = \mu_\{max\} - k_BT\ln \kappa(\mu)$$

As $\kappa$ is the reciprocal of the luminescence quantum yield, it may
frequently be determined experimentally. For the remainder of this
section we assume that $\kappa$ is independent of $\mu$, although it
appears that this is generally true only for noninteracting excitations
obeying Boltzmann statistics.

## Power Stored by Light Absorption

Work is one of the more popular commodities which can result from the
photochemical absorption of light, so that frequently one desires to
maximize the amount of power stored by such a system.

The amount of power stored is: $$\label\{Eq12\}
P= (R_\{in\} - R_\{loss\})\mu$$

where $R_\{loss\}$ is the rate of $E$-to-$G$ transitions which are not
coupled to the work-storage process.

We define the quantum yield for the loss processes: $$\label\{Eq14\}
\phi_\{loss\} = \frac\{R_\{loss\}\}\{R_\{out\}\}$$

From ([\[Eq11\]](#Eq11)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq11"\}) we know
that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq15\}
\mu &= \mu_\{max\} - k_BT\ln\left(\frac\{R_\{out\}\}\{R_\{lum\}\}\right) \notag\\
&= \mu_\{max\} - k_BT\ln\left(\frac\{R_\{loss\}\}\{R_\{lum\}\}\right) + k_BT\ln\left(\frac\{R_\{loss\}\}\{R_\{out\}\}\right) \notag\\
&= \mu_0 + k_BT\ln\phi_\{loss\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\mu_0 = \mu_\{max\} - k_B\ln\left( \frac\{R_\{loss\}\}\{R_\{lum\}\}\right)$
is the potential difference in the absence of the workstorage process.

Since $R_\{in\} = R_\{out\}$, we may rewrite the amount of power stored as:
$$\label\{Eq16\}
P=R_\{in\}\mu(1-\phi_\{loss\})$$ This expression may be maximized by
appropriate choice of $\mu$ and $\phi_\{loss\}$.

It can be shown that in the case of $\mu_0/k_BT\gg 1$, the power storage
is approximately maximal when $\phi_\{loss\}=k_BT/\mu_0$, so that the
optimal potential is roughly: $$\label\{Eq17\}
\mu=\mu_0 -k_BT\ln\left(\frac\{\mu_0\}\{k_BT\}\right)$$

The Planck-law relation itself has a number of applications, some of
which are suggested by the work which has already been done. One of the
important applications is the use of an absorption spectrum to calculate
a luminescence spectrum for systems in which luminescence has not been
observed experimentally. Prediction of the luminescence spectrum may be
useful in calculating energy-transfer probabilities, and may assist in
locating the luminescence experimentally. Examination of differences
between predicted and observed luminescence spectra may provide a check
on the experimental methods used, and represents a tool for examining
deviations from the usual assumption of complete vibrational equilibrium
in a two-level system [@Ross1967a].
