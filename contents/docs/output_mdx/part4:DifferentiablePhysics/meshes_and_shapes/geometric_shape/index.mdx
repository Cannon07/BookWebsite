\"\"\" Given many variants of geometry representations (meshes with
different samplings, point clouds, triangle soups), the operator
approach has been adopted to design algorithms that are invariant to the
geometry representation. The operator approach considers the
discretization of some continuous operator, whose behavior mimics that
of the continuous counterpart, thus remaining stable and consistent
across geometry representations. While the intrinsic Laplace--Beltrami
operator has been a ubiquitous choice thanks to its often desirable
properties such as invariance to isometries, it fails to capture the
spatial embedding of a shape because it discards extrinsic information.
To address these challenges, several alternative operators for shape
analysis have been proposed in recent work, including the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and the Dirac operator, in addition to
variants of modified Laplacian operators. I will give an extensive
survey on these operators and explain how these operators can be
utilized in the geometric learning setting. Finally, I will talk about a
neural architecture to learn task-specific geometric operators, whose
design is inspired by the success of the operator approach to shape
analysis. \"\"\"
