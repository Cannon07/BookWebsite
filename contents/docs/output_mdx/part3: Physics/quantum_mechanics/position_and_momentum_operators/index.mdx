In this chapter we define the quantum mechanical analogues to position
and momentum, the position and momentum operators. The general pattern
is that the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics turns
classically vectorial quantities such as position and momentum into
operators. This process is called *quantization*. The intuition is that
the state space in quantum mechanics is more complex than that for
classical mechanics. In classical physical theories, typically a state
was a vector in $\mathbb\{R\}^n$. However, in quantum mechanics we operate
in a larger Hilbert space of wave functions. It turns out that the right
formulation for common quantities turns out to be operators that
transform wave functions.

## Position Operators

The position of a wave functions is a trickier prospect than the
position of a particle. Unlike a particle, the wave function $\psi$
spreads out over all of space. How can we pick any one position for the
wave function? One way to make sense of this is to use the fact that
$\psi$ defines a probability density $\rho$. Perhaps we could define the
position of a wave function as the expected value of probability density
$\rho$?
$$E_\rho[x] = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} x |\psi(x)|^2 dx = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} \psi^* x \psi dx$$

This seems to be getting a little closer to what we're looking for, but
is still a little unsatisfactory. The particle doesn't necessarily have
to be at $E_\rho[x]$. However, we can re-use a part of the definition
above to define the position operator by
$$(\hat\{x\} \psi)(x) = x \psi(x)$$ That is, we have the identity
$$E_\rho[x] = \langle \psi | \hat\{x\} | \psi \rangle$$ We can define this
operator in Physika

``` \{.python language="python"\}
def $\hat\{x\}$($\psi$: $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$) -> $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$:
  return $\lambda$ x: x * $\psi(x)$
```

One mathematical subtlety is the fact that $\hat\{x\}$ is not in
$\mathcal\{B\}(L^2(\mathbb\{R\}))$ so we're actually operating in a larger
type space. The reason is that the norm of the $\hat\{x\}$ operator can
get unboundedly large. To see this, note that the identity function
$f(x) = x$ is not in $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$ since it has unbounded norm

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\}\|x\|^2 dx = \infty
\end\{aligned\}$$

As a result, multiplying by $x$ can take functions in $L^2$ outside
$L^2$. For this reason, we have to restrict the definition of the
position operator to a subset of $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$ such that multiplying
by $x$ does not exist $L^2$. This space is the Schwartz space
$\mathcal\{S\}(\mathbb\{R\})$. The picture is a bit more complicated even in
that we want to operate on the dual space of the Schwartz space, which
is the space of tempered distributions. So $\hat\{x\}$ takes a tempered
distribution over $\mathbb\{R\}$ to another tempered distribution

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\hat\{x\}: \mathcal\{S\}(\mathbb\{R\}) \to \mathcal\{S\}(\mathbb\{R\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Momentum Operator

Momentum is also defined as an operator in the quantum mechanical
formulation. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\hat\{p\}_x = -i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can define this operator in Physika as

``` \{.python language="python"\}
def $\hat\{p\}$($\psi$: $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$) $\to$ $L^2(\mathbb\{R\})$:
  return -i * $\hbar$ * $\nabla$($(\psi)$)
```

It turns out that momentum like position is an unbounded operator (to
convince yourself of this fact, take the Fourier transform, in which
basis the momentum operator is multiplication by $p$). For this reason,
the momentum operator has the type

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\hat\{p\}: \mathcal\{S\}(\mathbb\{R\}) \to \mathcal\{S\}(\mathbb\{R\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Position and Momentum Operators in 3D

The position and momentum operators can be defined naturally in 3D by
defining operators for each componeent.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{r\} &= (\hat\{x\}, \hat\{y\}, \hat\{z\}) \\
    \hat\{p\} &= (\hat\{p\}_x, \hat\{p\}_y, \hat\{p\}_z)
\end\{aligned\}$$

For convenience in formulas we will often also write $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{r\} &= (\hat\{x\}_1, \hat\{x\}_2, \hat\{x\}_3) \\
    \hat\{p\} &= (\hat\{p\}_1, \hat\{p\}_2, \hat\{p\}_3)
\end\{aligned\}$$

At times, we will drop the hats for convenience in formulas.

## Canonical Commutation Relationship

As operators, position and momentum no longer necessarily commute! In
fact, the position and momentum operators obey the following commutation
relationship

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [x_i, p_j] &= i \hbar \delta_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that we have dropped the hats from the formulas
above. Here $\delta_\{ij\}$ is the Kronecker Delta. We work through a
couple of these commutation relationships explicitly. Let's start with
the case $i = j = 1$

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [x_1, p_1](f) &= [x, -i\hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x\}](f) \\
    &= -i\hbar x\frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial x\}  + i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x\} \left (x f \right) \\
    &= -i\hbar x\frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial x\}  + i \hbar f + i \hbar x \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial x\} \\
    &= i \hbar f
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's now consider the case $i \neq j$.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [x_1, p_2](f) &= [x, -i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial y\}](f) \\
    &= -i \hbar x \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial y\} + i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial y\} \left (x f \right ) \\
    &= -i \hbar x \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial y\} + i \hbar x \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial y\} \\
    &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that in this case, since $x$ and $y$ are
independent variables, the relationships commute with one another.

## Momentum Wave Functions

Consider the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ describing a possible state of a
quantum particle. Once you rescale $\psi$ so it is normalized, the
absolute probability density is $$\begin\{aligned\}
p(x) &= |\psi(x)|^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ for any $x$. If you look closely at the solution for the
particle in a box, the wavelength $\lambda$ is equal to $2L/n$ and the
wavefunction $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_n(x) &=\sqrt\{\frac\{2\}\{L\}\} \sin\left (\frac\{n \pi x\}\{L\}\right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ can be expressed as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt\{\frac\{2\}\{L\}\}\sin \left( \frac\{ p_nx\}\{\hslash\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $p_n$ is momentum of the particle in state $n$ and
can be expressed in terms of wavelength using the de Broglie relation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
p_n &= \frac\{h\}\{\lambda_n\}
\end\{aligned\}$$. Remember $\hslash = h/2\pi$.

The wavefunction $\psi_p(x)$ of a particle in a state of momentum $p$
can be expressed as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_p(x)=e^\{ip x/\hslash\}
\end\{aligned\}$$. The subscript $p$ tells us that this wavefunction
describes a particle of definite momentum, say $p$. In quantum
mechanics, a particle of definite momentum $p$ has a definite wavelength
$\lambda$ as this function does.

This $\psi_p(x)$ is not normalized so we multiply it by a number $A$ and
choose A so that we get a normalized function $$\begin\{aligned\}
\int_\{\mathbb\{R\}\}|A|^2|e^\{\frac\{ipx\}\{\hslash\}\}|^2dx=\int_\{\mathbb\{R\}\}|A|^2dx=|A|^2L=1
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $L$ is the length of a box we consider. Hence, a
normalized state of momentum can be expressed as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_p(x)=\frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{L\}\}e^\{\frac\{ipx\}\{\hslash\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

In quantum mechanics, the complete information about the particle is
given by wavefunction $\psi(x)$. Given this $\psi(x)$ we can ask where
is the particle? As discussed earlier, the answer is you can find it any
place where $\psi(x)$ is non-zero and the probability density is
$P(x)=|\psi(x)|^2$.

Similarly, we can ask what happens if we measure the particle's
momentum. The information is contained in $\psi(x)$ itself. However, it
takes more work than simply finding $|\psi(x)|^2$, which was the case
for $P(x)$.

To answer the question, we can expand thes wavefunction in terms of
Fourier series, as follows: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi(x) &= \sum_\{p\} A_p \frac\{e^\{\frac\{ipx\}\{\hslash\}\}\}\{\sqrt\{L\}\}\\
&=\sum_\{p\}A_p\psi_p(x)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $A_p$ is given as $$\begin\{aligned\}
A_p=\int_\{0\}^\{L\}\frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{L\}\}e^\{-\frac\{ipx\}\{\hslash\}\}\psi(x) dx
\end\{aligned\}$$

The probability of obtaining a value of momentum $p$ would be
$$P(p)=|A_p|^2$$
