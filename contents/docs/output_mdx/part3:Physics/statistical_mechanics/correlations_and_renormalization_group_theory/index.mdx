In this chapter we discuss the effect of range of correlations on phase
transitions. This correlations can be experimentally measured by
scattering experiments, as we will review in subsequent chapters. We
also introduce the renormalization group theory. This method has the
particularity that it accounts for large length scale fluctuations and
is essential for the study of phase transitions. We start with the
one-dimensional Ising model, as several of the concepts of the
Renormalization Group theory can be illustrated for this case. Then we
end with the study of two-dimensional systems.

## Correlations in a system

We showed earlier that the critical point is associated with a
divergence in the fluctuations in the magnetization, energy, or number
of particles. We call these variables, *order parameters*, *i.e*
fluctuating variables whose average values provide the information about
the order or broken symmetry of the system. From Monte Carlo
simulations, we observe that these fluctuations are highly correlated as
we approach the critical point.

It is useful to introduce the concept of *range of correlations*, which
consider the distance over which fluctuations in one region
$(s_i - \langle s_i \rangle)$ of space, are correlated or affected by
those in another region $(s_j - \langle s_j \rangle)$. Mathematically:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
c_\{ij\} &= \langle (s_i - \langle s_i \rangle)(s_j - \langle s_j \rangle)\rangle \\
&=\langle s_i s_j \rangle -2 \langle s_i \rangle \langle s_j \rangle + \langle s_i \rangle \langle s_j \rangle \\
&= \langle s_i s_j \rangle - \langle s_i\rangle\langle s_j\rangle 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $c_\{ij\}$ is called the *correlation function*.

If two sites are separated over a larger distance than the range
predicted by $c_\{ij\}$, these two points are uncorrelated of each other.
In terms of the magnetic model, two correlated spins are likely to be
aligned in the same direction. Thus, we can anticipate that the
spontaneous magnetization phenomena is associated with *long range
correlations*.

In fact, there is a direct relationship between the correlation function
and the fluctuations in magnetization, as we explain bellow:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\left(\frac\{\partial \langle M\rangle\}\{\partial \beta h\}\right)_\{\beta,N\} &= \langle (\delta M)^2\rangle \\
&= \langle (M - \langle M \rangle)(M - \langle M \rangle)\rangle \\
&= \Bigg\langle \left(\sum_\{i=1\}^N \left[ s_i - \langle s_i\rangle \right] \right)\left(\sum_\{j=1\}^N \left[ s_j - \langle s_j\rangle \right]\right)\Bigg\rangle \\
&=\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N \left[\langle s_i s_j \rangle - \langle s_i\rangle\langle s_j\rangle\right] \\
&=N\sum_\{j=1\}^N c_\{1,j\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where in the last part, we consider the fact that the lattice sites are
equivalent.

Thus, the divergence of fluctuations at the critical point is directly
related with long range of correlations between neighboring spins. When
this occurs, the distance of these correlations becomes macroscopic, so
even very distant spins will tend to align, forming the big blobs
observed in the Monte Carlo simulation.

In the mean-field approximation, we assumed an average magnetization for
the neighboring spins, $\langle s_i \rangle = m$ ($c_\{i j\} = 0$ for
$i \neq j$), thus neglecting spatial correlations. This explains the
discrepancies of our approximation with respect to the exact solution.
Quantifying the effective interaction between distal spins is a powerful
way to think about the physical effect of correlations.

## Renormalization Group Theory

In order to conceptualize the correlations in the Ising model, it is
extremely useful to understand how the correlations lead to effective
long-range interactions. *Renormalization Group Theory* is an analytical
method of coarse graining an interacting system to address how physical
interactions are impacted by spatial correlations correlations.

The basic procedure of Renormalization Group Theory is:

-   Begin with the original theory with all of relevant degrees of
    freedom (e.g. the spins $s_i$ in the Ising model).

-   Separate degrees of freedom into one set that will be summed over
    first and one that will summed over second.

-   Perform the summation over the set of degrees of freedom.

-   Define a new theory based on the remaining degrees of freedom that
    has coarse-grained (or renormalized) parameters.

-   Identify the renormalization group equations that pass the theory to
    the next level, successively solve these equations

## Renormalization Group Theory of the 1D Ising model

Consider the 1D Ising model with $h = 0$, defined according to the
system energy: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\beta E=-J\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i s_\{i+1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The partition function is defined by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
Q(J,N) = \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=-1,1\}\exp[J(...+s_1s_2+s_2s_3+s_3s_4++s_4s_5+...)]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Although this has an exact solution, we will employ
Renormalization Group Theory to address the physics of this model
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}).

:::

Arrange the partition into terms that isolate the even spins, *i.e.*:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Q(J,N) = \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=-1,1\}\exp[J(s_1s_2+s_2s_3)]\exp[J(s_3s_4+s_4s_5)]...
\end\{aligned\}$$ Perform the sum over all even spins, arriving at the
expression: $$\begin\{aligned\}
Q(J,N) = \sum_\{s_1,s_3,...,s_N=-1,1\}\left[e^\{J(s_1+s_3)\} + e^\{-J(s_1+s_3)\}\right]\cdot \\ 
\left[e^\{J(s_3+s_5)\}+e^\{-J(s_3+s_5)\}\right]...
\end\{aligned\}$$

Now, recast the partial-summed theory to look the same as the original
theory with $N/2$ spins and (perhaps) a new coupling constant $J'$. This
is accomplished if we can find a function $f (J)$ and coupling constant
$J'$ that satisfies $$\begin\{aligned\}
e^\{J(s+s')\}+e^\{-J(s+s')\} = f(J)e^\{J'ss'\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ for any values of $s, s' = -1,1$. If this transformation
is possible, the partition function becomes:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
Q(J,N) &= \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=-1,1\} f(J) e^\{J's_1s_3\}f(J) e^\{J's_3s_5\}... \\
&= [f(J)]^\{N/2\}Q(J',N/2)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $Q(J',N/2)$ has the same form as the original theory.

To find $f(J)$ and $J'$, consider two scenarios:

-   If $s = s' = \pm 1$, the coarse-graining criterion is:

    $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \label\{Eq3\}
    e^\{2J\}+e^\{-2J\}=f(J)e^\{J'\}
    \end\{aligned\}$$

-   If $s = -s' = \pm 1$, the coarse-graining criterion is:
    $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \label\{Eq4\}
    2=f(J)e^\{-J'\}
    \end\{aligned\}$$

These two criteria are easily solved to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
J' &= \frac\{1\}\{2\} \log [\cosh(2J)]\\
f(J) &= 2\cosh^\{1/2\}(2J) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

and we define $g(J) = N^\{-1\} \log Q$, resulting in the expression:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
g(J')=2g(J)-\log\left[ 2\sqrt\{\cosh(2J)\} \right] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

These are the *renormalization group equations*. The inverses of these
equations are:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
J&=\frac\{1\}\{2\}\cosh^\{-1\}\left( e^\{2J'\} \right) \hspace\{0.2cm\} \\
g(J) &= \frac\{1\}\{2\} g(J') + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \log 2 + \frac\{J'\}\{2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Successive application of the RG equations always decreases the coupling
constant $J$, except for the initial value $J \rightarrow \infty$
(Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}). The
loss of coupling implies the lack of long-range order associated with a
phase transition. Conditions where $J' = J$ is called a fixed point of
the theory, which identifies a state whose physical behavior is
length-scale invariant (*self-similar*). The 1D Ising model has a stable
fixed point at $J = 0$ and an unstable fixed point at
$J \rightarrow \infty$.

## Renormalization Group Theory of the 2D Ising model

The 2D Ising model can also be addressed using Renormalization Group
theory. We follow a similar procedure as in the 1D case, though several
approximations need to be made.

The partition function organized into terms such that:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
Q = \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=-1,1\} \dotsc \exp[Js_5(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)]  \\ 
\times \exp[Js_6(s_2+s_3+s_7+s_8)] \dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $s_5$ and $s_6$ are among the spins that we will first sum over
(Fig [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3"\}).

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/correlations_and_renormalization_group_theory/renormalization_2d_coupling.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Sum over half the spins to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
Q = \sum_\{\text\{remaining \}s_i\} \dotsc \left[ e^\{J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} + e^\{-J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} \right] \\
\times \left[ e^\{J(s_2+s_3+s_7+s_8)\} + e^\{-J(s_2+s_3+s_7+s_8)\} \right] \dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$

It would be desirable to find a set of renormalization group equations
based on: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
e^\{J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} + e^\{-J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} = f(J) e^\{J'(s_1s_2+s_1s_4+s_2s_3+s_3s_4)\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

however this will prove to be impossible.

Since there exist unique scenarios for $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$, $s_4$, such
that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
s_1 &=s_2=s_3=s_4 = \pm 1 \\
s_1 &=s_2=s_3=-s_4 = \pm 1 \\
s_1 &=s_2=-s_3=-s_4 = \pm 1 \\
s_1 &=-s_2=-s_3=-s_4 = \pm 1 
\end\{aligned\}$$

the model is overspecified (4 equations, 2 unknowns), and the
coarse-grained theory cannot have the same form as the original.

The simplest possibility is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
&e^\{J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} + e^\{-J(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4)\} = \\
 &f(J)\exp \left[ \frac\{1\}\{2\}J_1(s_1s_2+s_2s_3+s_3s_4+s_4s_1) + J_2(s_1s_3+s_2s_4) + J_3s_1s_2s_3s_4 \right] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since there are 4 equations and 4 unknowns, these can be solved to find:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
J_1 &= \frac\{1\}\{4\}\log[\cosh(4J)] \\
J_2 &= \frac\{1\}\{8\}\log[\cosh(4J)] \\
J_3 &= \frac\{1\}\{8\}\log[\cosh(4J)] - \frac\{1\}\{2\}\log[\cosh(4J)] \\
f(J) &= 2[\cosh(2J)]^\{1/2\}[\cosh(4J)]^\{1/8\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Inserting this into the partition function, we have:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
Q(J,N) = [f(J)]^\{N/2\} \sum_\{N/2 spins\}\exp\left[ J_1\sum_\{ij\}\{'\}s_i s_j + \right. \\
 \left. J_2\sum_\{lm\}\{''\}s_l s_m + J_3\sum_\{pqrt\}\{'''\}s_p s_q s_r s_t \right] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\sum\{'\}$ is over nearest neighbors, $\sum\{''\}$ is over
next-nearest neighbors, and $\sum\{'''\}$ is over four spins in a square.

This demonstrates that coarse-graining introduces new interactions into
the theory that did not exist in the original theory. However, we cannot
use this structure, since the next renormalization step will introduce
even more complex interactions. Therefore, we make the approximation:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
J_1\sum_\{ij\}\{'\}s_is_j+J_2\sum_\{lm\}\{''\}s_ls_m \approx J'(J_1,J_2)\sum_\{ij\}\{'\}s_is_j
\end\{aligned\}$$

and neglect the 4-spin interaction ($J_3 \approx 0$).

This approximation gives:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
Q(J,N) = [f(J)]^\{N/2\} Q[J'(J_1,J_2),N/2]
\end\{aligned\}$$

and the free energy is found from
$g(J)=\frac\{1\}\{2\}\log f(J)+\frac\{1\}\{2\}g(J')$.

To estimate $J'$, consider the case where all the spins are aligned.
Since we have $N/2$, there are $N$ near neighbors and $N$ next-near
neighbors, thus $J_1\sum_\{i j\}\{'\}s_is_j = NJ_1$ and
$J_2\sum_\{lm\}\{''\}s_ls_m = NJ_2$. Therefore, we estimate that
$J'\approx J_1+J_2$.

Using our RG equations for $J_1$ and $J_2$, we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
J'=\frac\{3\}\{8\}\log[\cosh(4J)] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Unlike the 1D Ising model, the RG equation for the 2D system has a
non-trivial fixed point $J_c = 0.50698$ that satisfies
$J_c = \frac\{3\}\{8\}\log[\cosh(4J_c)]$. The critical point $J_c$ dictates
conditions where the correlations diverge at all length scales (i.e. the
system is self-similar) and marks the onset of a phase transition
(Fig. [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}).

## Coarse-Grained Physical Models

Renormalization Group theory gives a systematic method for coarse
graining a physical model. In many instances, the insights that can be
gained by coarsegraining can provide fundamental insight into the
dominant physics. For example, coarse-graining concepts have been
pivotal in polymer physics (Fig. [\[fig5\]](#fig5)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig5"\}, [\[fig6\]](#fig6)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig6"\}).
