Numerical relativity methods study general relavistic spacetimes which
cannot be solved exactly with known methods. Numerical relativity has
recently risen to prominence (at time of writing) due to its role in
helping facilitate the detection of gravitational waves.

## Basic Formulation

One basic but tricky challenge in numerical relativity is that
space-time is a unified entity that doesn't directly split into space
and time as with other PDE systems in physics. For this reason, we must
first perform a foliation of the space we consider into spacelike and
timelike components to split them out.

## Solution Methods

The method of lines is a technique for decoupling treatment of space and
time. Runge-kutta methods can be used to integrate from there.

Filtering operators and dissipation operators provide more sophisticated
spectral methods of simulation which can be crucial for larger systems.
