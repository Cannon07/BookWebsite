The Dirac equation provides a mechanism for modeling relativistic
quantum mechanical systems. Wave functions as used in the Dirac equation
are bispinors instead of the usual complex numbers seen elsewhere in
quantum mechanics.

## A Brief Introduction to Spinors

The use of spinors is needed to model the intrinsic spin of the system.
The wave-function on spacetime is consequently of the form

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi: \mathbb\{R\}^\{1, 3\} \to \mathbb\{C\}^4
\end\{aligned\}$$

The space these functions live in is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathcal\{H\} &= L^2(\mathbb\{R\}^\{1, 3\}, \mathbb\{C\}^4)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The bispinor is given by vectors in $\mathbb\{C\}^4$. The Dirac equation
itself is written in terms of a bispinor field $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\} \mapsto \mathbb\{C\}^4
\end\{aligned\}$$

## The Form of the Dirac Equation

The Dirac equation is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (i \hbar \gamma^\{\mu\} \partial_\{\mu\}  - m c) \psi(x) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we use Einstein summation over the components $\mu$
of space-time where $$\begin\{aligned\}
\gamma^\{\mu\} : \mathbb\{C\}^\{4\times 4\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ and $\psi$ is a bispinor field $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi: \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\} \mapsto \mathbb\{C\}^4
\end\{aligned\}$$

In natural units, this equation can be rewritten as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (i\slashed\{\partial\} - m)\psi(x) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ where we define $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \slashed\{\partial\} &= \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Dirac equation provides us a set of 4 coupled
partial differential equations. Note that in particular, if we apply
$(i\slashed\{partial\} + m$ as an operator to both sides of the Dirac
equation, we obtain the Klein-Gordon equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (i\slashed\{\partial\} - m)(i\slashed\{\partial\} + m)\psi &= 0 \\
    (\partial_\mu \partial^\mu + m^2) \psi &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ So each component of the Dirac equation satisfies the
Klein-Gordon equation.

## Invariances

The Dirac equation is invariant under actions of the Lorentz group. This
follows from the use of the covariant derivative $\partial_\{\mu\}$.

## Solving the Dirac Equation

When solving Dirac's equation, it is useful to start from an ansatz
about the solution $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(x) &= u(p') e^\{-p \dot x\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $p, x \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{1,3\}$ are 4-vectors where $p$
is the momentum. $$\begin\{aligned\}
p &= (E_p, p')    
\end\{aligned\}$$ This ansatz leads to $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (\gamma^\{\mu\} p_\{\mu\} - m)u(p')
\end\{aligned\}$$ For a particle at rest, the momentum term disappears so
we have a simplified equation

## Quantizing Dirac's Equation

Quantizing Dirac's equation becomes a good bit trickier than quantizing
the Klein-Gordon equation.
