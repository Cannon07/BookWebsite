Water is the key compound for our existence on this planet and it is
involved in nearly all chemical, biological and geological processes.
Access to clean water is also one of the most challenging questions for
mankind in the coming century, in particular with the prospect of global
warming. Although water is the most common molecular substance it is
also the most unusual with many peculiar properties such as increased
density upon melting, decreased viscosity under pressure, density
maximum at $4 ^\{\circ\}C$, high surface tension and many more.

In this chapter, we will study the physical mechanism behind the unique
properties of water, by discussing its molecular and thermodynamic
behavior.

## The Anomaly of Water in the Supercooled region

:::

The mysterious properties of water become even more extreme in the
supercooled region below the freezing point, but they appear also under
ambient conditions. One example
(Fig.[\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}a) is the
isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_T$, related to volume, or
equivalently density, fluctuations in the liquid, where $\kappa_T$
decreases upon cooling as for a normal liquid, but only down to
$46 ^\{\circ\}C$ where it starts to increase again upon further cooling,
indicating that density fluctuations in the liquid increase as thermal
energy is removed. Another is the heat capacity at constant pressure,
$C_P$, which is related to fluctuations in the entropy and again this
property of water shows an anomalous increase compared to normal liquids
already at $35 ^\{\circ\} C$ (Fig.[\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig1"\}b). The thermal expansion coefficient, $\alpha _P$,
which is related to the crosscorrelation between fluctuations in density
and entropy, becomes negative for water below the density maximum at
$4 ^\{\circ\} C$ (Fig.[\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig1"\}c). Characteristic for all three is that they are
related to fluctuations in the liquid and that these increase upon
cooling contrary to expectation for normal, simple liquids. Importantly,
while these fluctuations and apparent divergences of thermodynamical
response functions are most evident when water is supercooled below
$0 ^\{\circ\} C$, they start to influence water properties already in the
ambient, biologically relevant regime and grow in importance in a
continuous, but rapidly increasing fashion as thermal energy is removed.
One of the most essential questions to address for a microscopic
understanding of water is then: What is the structure and dynamics of
the hydrogen bonding (hydrogen bonding) network in water that gives rise
to all these unique properties? This question has been discussed
intensively for over 100 years and has not yet been resolved. In order
to gain new unique information regarding the structure of the hydrogen
bond network in water, it is essential to develop new techniques, both
experimental and theoretical.

## Polarizability

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/water/fig2.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

The water molecule has a bent structure due to the structure of the
$sp^3$ orbitals of the $O-H$ bonds and the unshared electrons of the
oxygen atom (Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig2"\}). Since oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,
the electrons in the $O-H$ bond congregate near the oxygen atom, leading
to a dipole moment of $m = ql\approx 6\times 10^\{-30\}Cm$ ($q$ is charge
separation and $l$ is separation distance). The dipole moment of water
molecules results in electrostatic interactions that tend to order water
in the liquid phase.

The energy of interaction for two monovalent ions (same charge) in a
dielectric medium is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
E_\{coulomb\}=k_BT\frac\{l_B\}\{r\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $T$ is the temperature of the medium, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann
constant, $r$ is the separation of charges, and $l_B$ is the Bjerrum
length, which is the length scale at which the electrostatic energy of
interactions equals the thermal energy of the system, and is given by:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
l_B= \frac\{e^2\}\{k_BT\varepsilon\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the
medium, and $e$ is the elementary charge of electron
($e=1.602 \times 10^\{-19\} C$).

Consider two dipoles with orientations $\vec\{u\}_1$ and $\vec\{u\}_2$
separated by a vector $\vec\{r\} =\vec\{r\}_1-\vec\{r\}_2$. The valance of the
charge separation is $z$, which is separated by a distance $l$.

The total energy of interaction between the dipole is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{E_\{d-d\}\}\{l_Bz^2k_BT\} = &\frac\{1\}\{|\vec\{r\} + \frac\{l\}\{2\}(\vec\{u\}_1 - \vec\{u\}_2)|\} - \frac\{1\}\{|\vec\{r\} + \frac\{l\}\{2\}(\vec\{u\}_1 - \vec\{u\}_2)|\} + \notag\\
&\frac\{1\}\{|\vec\{r\} - \frac\{l\}\{2\}(\vec\{u\}_1 - \vec\{u\}_2)|\} - \frac\{1\}\{|\vec\{r\} - \frac\{l\}\{2\}(\vec\{u\}_1 - \vec\{u\}_2)|\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

For $|\vec\{r\}|\gg l$, we expand $E_\{d-d\}$ is powers of $l$, giving to
order $l^2$.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
E_\{d-d\} &= \frac\{l_Bz^2k_BTl^2\}\{r^3\}(I - 3\vec\{e\}_r\vec\{e\}_r):\vec\{u\}_1\vec\{u\}_2 \notag\\ 
&= \frac\{1\}\{\varepsilon r^3\}(I - 3\vec\{e\}_r\vec\{e\}_r):\vec\{\mu\}_1\vec\{\mu\}_2 \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\vec\{\mu\}_1 = ezl\vec\{u\}_1$ is the dipole moment and
$\vec\{e\}_r =\vec\{r\}/r$.

The dipole-dipole interaction energy is long-ranged
($E_\{d-d\} \sim r^\{-3\}$), thus there can be long-ranged dipole
correlations in a solution. The *polarizability* of a solution can lead
to dramatic consequences in the physical behavior. For example, an ion
in a polarizable medium will order the opposite charged ends of dipoles
around the ion. This effectively shields the interaction between the
ions. This effect is generally captured in the dielectric constant
$\varepsilon$ of the medium, thus the polarizable medium acts as an
effective medium for electrostatic interaction
(Fig. [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3"\}).

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/water/fig4.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Since the polarizability leads to shielding of the charge-charge
interactions, the dielectric constant increases with polarizability of
the medium, thus decreasing the Bjerrum length
$l_B = \frac\{e^2\}\{k_BT\varepsilon\}$. Dipole ordering is energetically
favorable and is entropically unfavorable due to the loss of rotational
entropy of the molecules. Therefore, the dielectric constant is
temperature dependent. Raising the temperature prefers the molecules to
engage in rotational fluctuations, thus reducing the shielding effect,
thus the dielectric constant tends to decrease with temperature
(Fig.[\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}).

## Hydrogen bonding

Another consequence of the electronegativity of oxygen is *hydrogen
bonding*, which occurs when the partial positive hydrogen on a donor
bonds with the lone pair electrons on an acceptor. The strength of the
hydrogen bonds in water is approximately $8k_BT$, thus significantly
larger than the mean thermal energy.\

Since each oxygen can accept a hydrogen bond with 2 different water
molecules, liquid water tends to form hydrogen bond networks that
dramatically influence water's physical properties. At low temperatures,
molecules in liquid water arrange in a densely packed near-tetrahedral
network, having about 4.4 neighboring per atom
(Fig. [\[fig7\]](#fig7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig7"\}), called
*High density liquid phase* (HDL). At higher temperatures, a less dense
structure is formed, with less than 4 neighbors per atom, named *Low
density liquid phase*. At room temperature these two phases coexist, as
we will see in the next section.

The structure of ice consists of two interpenetrating lattice with
hexagonal close packed symmetry, resulting in four hydrogen bonds per
$H_2O$ molecule (Fig. [\[fig8\]](#fig8)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig8"\}). The transition from solid water to liquid water
results in the molecules having more rotational degrees of freedom that
disrupt the hydrogen bond network. Since the hydrogen bond distance no
longer constrains the molecular spacing as much in the liquid phase, the
liquid phase is denser than the solid phase. Further increase of
temperature above the solid-liquid transition leads to further
densification with temperature (up to $4^\{\circ\}C$)

Hydrogen bonding in the liquid state causes water to be substantially
more ordered than the liquid-phase of other substances. Comparing the
pair correlation function of the oxygen in water against the pair
correlation function of argon
(Fig. [\[fig10\]](#fig10)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig10"\}), we
see:

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/water/fig10.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

-   The integral under the first peak shows that water molecules have
    about 4.4 first-shell neighbors and argon has about 10 first-shell
    neighbors.

-   However, the water molecules are more ordered than the argon atoms,
    as indicated by the width of the first peak and number of subsequent
    peaks.

Due to hydrogen bonding, water has a significantly higher melting and
boiling points than comparable molecules. Hydrogen bonding also
influences a number of dynamic properties of water (*e.g.* viscosity and
diffusivity) that make water a unique and important substance.

## Phases of Liquid Water

As we learned from water's behavior, there exist two separate liquid
phases, *High Density Liquid* (HDL) and *Low Density Liquid* (LDL), with
a coexistence line in the $p-T$ diagram deep in the supercooled regime
and at elevated pressures (Fig. [\[fig5\]](#fig5)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig5"\}). This line ends with decreasing pressure in a
critical point and its extension into the one-phase region corresponds
to the Widom line. At the Widom line the density fluctuations would
reach a maximum consistent with equal population of molecules in HDL and
LDL related structures. The presence of the Widom line leads to
fluctuations that extend over a very large temperature range and can be
observed well above ambient conditions. We note that the HDL is on the
ambient temperature side of the Widom line, whereas LDL is on the low
temperature side. This explains why the high density, hydrogen bond
distorted species dominates at ambient conditions. The origin of the
anomalous properties of water is the increase in density fluctuations as
water is cooled down and approach the Widom line leading to fluctuating
tetrahedral patches growing in size as directional hydrogen bonding
becomes relatively more important. We should also note that in the
schematic picture, the boundary between the HDL and LDL regions is not
sharp and the density should vary in a continuous fashion. Furthermore,
the regions are not of one particular size and shape but should
represent a distribution, where the average changes with temperature.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/part2a/statistical_mechanics/water/fig5.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

The driving force to energetically allow for the formation of HDL must
be the more isotropic van der Waals interactions together with quantum
effects leading to both weaker hydrogen bond strength and, in addition,
to quantized vibrational modes which become thermally inaccessible in
tetrahedral coordination. Tetrahedral ice is quite unique among all the
condensed structures with an extremely low coordination number of 4.
Most other cubic and hexagonal solids have a nearest neighbor
coordination of 12. This low coordination is the result of the
directional hydrogen bonds in the tetrahedral coordination. What makes
HDL have a density significantly lower than for the high-pressure ices
is that the first shell is distorted in order to allow thermal
excitation of vibrational modes. It has been speculated that these
distortions are not symmetrical but instead asymmetrical in order to
minimize loss of enthalpy leading to a doubly hydrogen bonded local
structure. It turns out that the hydrogen bond energy is maximized when
there is an equal number of donor and acceptor bonds and a particularly
favorable situation in terms of energy per hydrogen bond is when each
molecule forms only one bond of each kind. This would lead to a
stabilization of doubly hydrogen bonded structures which interact with
the surrounding through more isotropic forces and gain entropy since the
vibrational modes would become thermally accessible. Such a picture is
supported based on thermodynamic grounds where it has been argued that
over a large range of the liquid-vapor coexistence line the averaged
water interaction potential should resemble that of liquid Argon, *i.e.*
hydrogen bonding is not dominating resulting in mostly a doubly hydrogen
bonded structure. Furthermore, one model suggests, also based on
thermodynamic arguments, that the hydrogen bonding structure upon
melting of ice should mostly correspond to breaking of hydrogen bonds
between rings in the tetrahedral ice structure while keeping the
internal ring structure intact. This would also lead to a local doubly
hydrogen bonded picture.

The varying phases of liquid water can be studied by means of XRD
scans - they allow us to differentiate between the phases, because of
their differing average bond distance. On a given scan, for a similar
$r$-value, LDL has a higher-intensity peak, and HDL has a
lower-intensity but wider peak
(Fig.[\[fig6\]](#fig6)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig6"\}). The
structure of liquid water is still a subject of intense debate and the
picture is one that is still evolving.

## Hydrophobicity

::: marginfigure

:::

::: marginfigure

:::

A further consequence of hydrogen bonding is the *hydrophobic effect*,
where non-polar substances are excluded by water in order to maintain a
confluent hydrogen bonded network. Hydrophobicity does not arise due to
favorable \"hydrophobic interaction\", rather the non-polar molecules
come together because putting water molecules next to them would
eliminate the opportunity for those molecules to hydrogen bond with
other water molecules. Essentially, the surrounding water presses the
hydrophobic groups together to maximize their contacts with each other.
Hydrophobicity is responsible for the de-mixing of oil (nonpolar
hydrocarbons) and water. Hydrophobic amino acids drive the collapse of
proteins in order to sequester these side chains from the surrounding
solution. Another phenomena related to Hydrophobicity, is the so-called
*Lotus effect* (Fig. [\[lotusleaf\]](#lotusleaf)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="lotusleaf"\}), which refers to the self cleaning properties of
lotus leaves, as a result of the high water repellence that forbids the
adhesion of water drops into the surface, leading to surface cleaning as
the dirt particles are picked by the water drops. Lotus effect is a
direct concequence of the micro- and nanoscopic architecture on the
surface (Fig. [\[lotussurface\]](#lotussurface)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="lotussurface"\}), and can be found in other plants such as
taro leaf, cane, and also on the wings of certain insects.
Superhydrophobic surfaces can be used for a variety of applications like
self-cleaning glasses, efficient power plant condensers, or
*lab-on-a-chip* microfluidic devices.
