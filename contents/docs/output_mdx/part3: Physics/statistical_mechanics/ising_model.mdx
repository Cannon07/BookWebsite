Thus far, our analyses have focused on non-interacting systems.
Non-interacting systems require the evaluation of a single-molecule
partition function, which generally is tractable (either exactly or
approximately). However, very few practical problems involve either
non-interacting molecules or approximately non-interacting molecules.
Furthermore, a variety of important physical phenomena are not exhibited
in non-interacting systems. For example, phase transitions are a
hallmark issue in interacting systems. Our goal for this chapter is to
discuss the effect of interactions on thermodynamic behavior.

We introduce the Ising Model, which constitutes the basis for the
analysis of long ranged correlations. Behind its apparently simple
formulation, the Ising model hides a complex mathematical problem,
specially for 2 or 3 dimensional systems, that requires a number of
approximations in order to derive a reasonable descriptive model for the
study of these correlations. Of course, there is always a cost
associated for using these approximations, and we will discuss these
limitations over the course of this chapter. For now, the behavior of
the Ising model in 1D system will be presented, and in the second part,
we will introduce the mean field approximation for the study of 2D
systems.

Consider a lattice of $N$ sites. The definition of the lattice can
include many different geometries (square lattice, triangular lattice,
etc..) and dimensionality (1 dimension, 2 dimensions, etc\...)
(Fig. [\[lattice\]](#lattice)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="lattice"\}). In the presence of a magnetic field, $h$, the
energy of the system in a particular state, $\nu$, is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
E_\nu &= -\sum_\{i=1\}^N h s_i + (\text\{energy due to interactions between spins\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ According to the expression, each site contains exactly
1 spin associated to its magnetic moment $\pm \mu$. Thus, the net
magnetic moment is defined by the spin state $s_i$, that is either spin
up ($s_i = +1$) or spin down ($s_i = -1$).

A simple model for the interaction energy is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
- J \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\}s_i s_j
\end\{aligned\}$$

where the sum over $\langle i j \rangle$ implies a summation over all
nearest neighbor pairs in the lattice, with a coupling strength $J$.

The system energy is now defined to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq1\}
E_\nu= -h\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i - J \sum_\{\langle i j \rangle\}s_i s_j
\end\{aligned\}$$

which is the Ising Model. In general, this model can be applied to a
variety of problems (magnetic systems, binary alloys, liquid-gas phase
transition, neural networks - Hopfield model).

Notice that when $J> 0$, it is energetically favorable that the
neighboring spins remain aligned. At low temperatures, this alignment
between spins will lead to a cooperative phenomenon called spontaneous
magnetization.

In general the sign of the coupling constant $J$ dictates whether the
spins prefer to align with their neighbors or anti-align
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}):

-   Ferromagnetic: the spins prefer to align with their neighbors,
    occurring when $J > 0$.

-   Antiferromagnetic: the spins prefer to anti-align with their
    neighbors, occurring when $J < 0$.

Define the total magnetization $M$ of the system to be:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
M = \bigg\langle \sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i \bigg\rangle = \frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial \beta h\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/ising_model/spont_magnetization.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

In the absence of an external magnetic field $h$, for $J>0$ we expect
the system to develop a net magnetization $\langle M \rangle$ at
temperatures below $T_c$, defined as the Curie Temperature or Critical
Temperature (Fig.[\[fig2a\]](#fig2a)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig2a"\})

### *Non-interacting case ($J = 0$)* \{#non-interacting-case-j-0 .unnumbered\}

The partition function for the Ising model with $J = 0$ is given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Z &= \sum_\{s_1=-1,1\}\sum_\{s_2=-1,1\}...\sum_\{s_N=-1,1\} \exp\left(\beta h\sum_\{i=1\}^Ns_i\right)\\
&=\prod_\{j=1\}^N \left(\sum_\{s_j=-1,1\}e^\{\beta h s_j\}\right) =\left(\sum_\{s=-1,1\}e^\{\beta h s\}\right)^N \\
&= \left(e^\{\beta h\} + e^\{-\beta h\}\right)^N \\
&= 2^N \cosh^N\left(\beta h \right) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

which is valid for any lattice type and dimensionality. The total
magnetization $M$ is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq2\}
M = \frac\{\partial \log Z\}\{\partial \beta h\} = N\tanh \left(\beta h \right) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The average energy $\langle E \rangle$ and entropy $S$ are given by:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle &= -h \bigg\langle \sum_\{i=1\}^Ns_i \bigg\rangle \\
&= -hM \\
&= -hN\tanh \left(\beta h \right) \\
S &= \frac\{E-F\}\{T\} \\
&= \frac\{-hN\tanh \left(\beta h \right) + Nk_BT\log\left[2\cosh \left(\beta h \right)\right]\}\{T\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Note, $\langle E \rangle \rightarrow -hN$ and $S\rightarrow 0$ as
$T \rightarrow 0$, and $\langle E \rangle \rightarrow 0$ and
$S \rightarrow Nk_B \log 2$ as $T \rightarrow \infty$.

The non-interacting Ising model ($J =0$) exhibits a gradual change in
the magnetization $M$ with the external field $h$
(Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}). Thus,
no phase transition is exhibited in the non-interacting case; there is
never a phase transition for non-interacting molecules. We now turn to
cases where the interactions are turned on, such that $J \neq 0$.

## *Ising model in 1 dimension* \{#ising-model-in-1-dimension .unnumbered\}

Consider a line of spins in $1$ dimension with periodic boundary
conditions such that $s_N$ interacts with $s_1$. For the Ising model in
$1$ dimension, the energy is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq3\}
\beta E = -\tilde\{h\} \sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i -\tilde\{J\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_is_\{i+1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
\tilde\{h\} & =\beta h  \\
\tilde\{J\} &= \beta J
\end\{aligned\}$$ Define a transfer function $T(s_i,s_\{i+1\})$ to be
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq4\}
T(s_i,s_\{i+1\}) &= \exp \left[ \tilde\{h\}\left(\frac\{s_i\}\{2\}+\frac\{s_\{i+1\}\}\{2\}\right)+\tilde\{J\}s_is_\{i+1\}\right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

With this definition, we write the partition function as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Z = \sum_\{s_1=-1,1\}\sum_\{s_2=-1,1\}...\sum_\{s_N=-1,1\} T(s_1,s_2)T(s_2,s_3)...T(s_N,s_1)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Now construct the *transfer matrix* to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq5\}
T = \left[ \begin\{array\}\{cc\} T(1,1) & T(1,-1) \\ T(-1,1) & T(-1,-1) \end\{array\} \right] = \left[ \begin\{array\}\{cc\} e^\{\tilde\{h\}+\tilde\{J\}\} & e^\{-\tilde\{J\}\} \\ e^\{-\tilde\{J\}\} & e^\{-\tilde\{h\}+\tilde\{J\}\} \end\{array\} \right] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

The partition function is then written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq6\}
Z = \sum_\{s_1=-1,1\}T^N(s_1,s_1) = Tr\{T^N\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $Tr\{T^N\}$ indicates a trace of the matrix $M$.

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues
of $T^N$ are $\lambda_\pm ^N$, where $\lambda_\pm$ are the eigenvalues
of $T$. In our case: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
\lambda_\pm =e^\{\tilde\{J\}\} \cosh \tilde\{h\} \pm \left(e^\{-2\tilde\{J\}\} + e^\{2\tilde\{J\}\}\sinh^2\tilde\{h\}\right)^\{1/2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the exact solution for the partition function is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
Z = \left[e^\{\tilde\{J\}\} \cosh \tilde\{h\} + \left(e^\{-2\tilde\{J\}\} + e^\{2\tilde\{J\}\}\sinh^2\tilde\{h\}\right)^\{1/2\}\right]^N + \\ \left[e^\{\tilde\{J\}\} \cosh \tilde\{h\} \pm \left(e^\{-2\tilde\{J\}\} + e^\{2\tilde\{J\}\}\sinh^2\tilde\{h\}\right)^\{1/2\}\right]^N 
\end\{aligned\}$$

:::

::: marginfigure

:::

For $\tilde\{J\} =0$, the partition function $Z=2^N \cosh^N \tilde\{h\}$,
which agrees with our previous result. For $\tilde\{h\}=0$, the partition
function
$Z=2^N\cosh^N\tilde\{J\} + 2^N\sinh^N\tilde\{J\} \approx 2^N\cosh^N\tilde\{J\}$
for large $N$.

Since $\lambda_+ > \lambda_-$, the partition function is
$Z \approx \lambda_+^N$ for $N \gg 1$. The average magnetization is
given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
M = \frac\{\partial \log Z\}\{\partial h\} = N \frac\{\sinh \tilde\{h\}\}\{\sqrt\{e^\{-4\tilde\{J\}\}\}+\sinh^2\tilde\{h\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ In the limit $\tilde\{h\} \rightarrow 0^+$, the
magnetization approaches zero. Thus, this exact solution for the 1D
Ising model does not exhibit a phase transition from a disordered state
to an ordered state. The physical justification for this lies in the
fact that forming a disordered phase from an ordered phase occurs
through an energy change $\Delta E = 4J$ in 1D (independent of $N$).
Thus, the net magnetization per particle should vanish for all
temperatures higher than $T\sim J/Nk_B$, which is very small considering
that $N$ is large for macroscopic systems
(Fig. [\[fig3b\]](#fig3b)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3b"\}a).

In higher dimensions ($D \geq 2$), the energy cost scales with $N$
(*e.g.* $\Delta E \sim N^\{1/2\}J$ in 2D), thus leading to a finite-$T$
phase transition (Fig. [\[fig3b\]](#fig3b)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig3b"\}b).

### Mean-field approximation \{#mean-field-approximation .unnumbered\}

The solution for the Ising model for $D \geq 2$ is not as easily found.
In 1944, Lars Onsager found an exact solution for the 2D Ising model for
$h = 0$ that exhibits a spontaneous magnetization for sufficiently large
$J$. However, there is no exact solution for the Ising model for
$D \geq 3$.

We introduce the mean-field approximation. The idea of this method is to
focus on one particular particle of the system, and assume that the role
of the neighboring particles is to form an average molecular magnetic
field, which acts on the tagged particle
(Fig. [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}). In the
next lecture, we test the limits of this approximation.

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/ising_model/Mean field.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Define the average magnetization per site $$\begin\{aligned\}
m=\frac\{M\}\{m\}=\frac\{1\}\{N\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\langle s_i\rangle = \langle s\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ by noting that spatial invariance implies
$\langle s_i\rangle = \langle s\rangle$. Define the coordination number
z as the number of nearest neighbors to any given site divided by $2$
(*e.g.* $z = 2$ for 2D square lattice and $z = 3$ for 3D square
lattice). The mean-field approximation replaces the near-neighbor
interactions by the average interaction, thus
$s_j \approx \langle s_j\rangle$, giving the energy approximation:

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/ising_model/tanh_K_plot.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq8\}
E &= -h\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i - J\sum_\{\langle i j\rangle\}s_is_j \\
&\approx -h\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i - Jzm\sum_\{i=1\}^N s_i
\end\{aligned\}$$

which reduces the problem to an effective non-interacting model.

Therefore, we write the average magnetization per site as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq9\}
m = \frac\{\sum_\{s=-1,1\}s \exp\left[ (\beta h + \beta Jzm) s \right]\}\{\sum_\{s=-1,1\} \exp\left[ (\beta h + \beta Jzm) s \right]\} = \tanh (\beta h + \beta Jzm)
\end\{aligned\}$$

which performs the average of the site magnetization using the
mean-field site energy in the Boltzmann weight for the spin probability.

For the case $h = 0$ (no external field), the magnetization satisfies
$$\begin\{aligned\}
m &= \tanh (Km)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $K = \beta Jz$. This is a self-consistent
mean-field equation. Local order is dictated by the surrounding order
that is itself defined by the local order, leading to a self-consistent
condition that must be met. Two scenarios exist
(Fig. [\[fig5\]](#fig5)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig5"\}):

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/ising_model/ising_phase_diagram0.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

-   For $K < 1$, there is only one solution for m that corresponds to
    $m = 0$.

-   For $K >1$, there are 3 solutions for $m$ corresponding to $m=0$ and
    $m=\pm m^*$. The solution $m=0$ is unphysical as it is a free energy
    maximum.

Therefore, $K = K_c = 1$ defines a critical temperature $T_c = Jz/k_B$,
and we can write $K = T_c/T$
(Fig. [\[fig6\]](#fig6)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig6"\}).

Near $T = T_c$, we can expand the self-consistent equation near $m = 0$
to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
m = \tanh \left( \frac\{T_c\}\{T\}m \right) \approx \frac\{T_c\}\{T\}m - \frac\{1\}\{3\}\left( \frac\{T_c\}\{T\}\right)^3m^3 \rightarrow m \approx \pm \sqrt\{\frac\{3\}\{T_c\}\}(T_c-T)^\{1/2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Generally, the external field $h$ acts as the intensive variable that is
conjugate to the magnetization $M$ (extensive variable). Earlier in the
book, we learned that thermodynamic stability dictates that a derivative
of an intensive variable with respect to its conjugate extensive
variable is a positive quantity, *e.g.*: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
\left( \frac\{\partial T\}\{\partial S\} \right)_\{V,N\} & > 0\\ 
- \left( \frac\{\partial p\}\{\partial V\} \right)_\{T,N\} &> 0\\
\left( \frac\{\partial \mu_i\}\{\partial N_i\} \right)_\{T,V,N_\{j\neq i\}\} &> 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Similarly, thermodynamic stability dictates that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq11\}
\left( \frac\{\partial \beta h\}\{\partial M\} \right)_\{\beta Jz,N\}>0
\end\{aligned\}$$

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/ising_model/ising_plot_m_bh.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

The phase diagram for the mean-field solution is dictated by the
self-consistent mean field equation
(Fig. [\[fig7\]](#fig7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig7"\}):
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq12\}
m = \tanh (\beta h + \beta Jzm)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This equation of state can be likened to the vapor-liquid equation of
state $p = p(v)$.

The phase diagram for the mean-field approximation for the Ising model
exhibits similar characteristics as the liquid-vapor phase diagram. The
correspondence between $M-h$ in the magnetic system and $p-V$ in the
liquid-vapor system reflects the universal physical issues that are
addressed with the Ising model and why it can be used to understand a
variety of phenomena (Fig. [\[fig9\]](#fig9)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig9"\}).
