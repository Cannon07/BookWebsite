\"\"\" The session with begin with a discussion on how to enable
material-property predictions by combining advanced statistical
mechanics with data-driven machine learning interatomic potentials. Two
example applications will be covered using first-principles
thermodynamic descriptions. Then, the talk will focus on why machine
learning potentials work at all, and in particular, the locality
argument. We will see that a machine-learning potential trained on
liquid water alone can predict the properties of diverse ice phases
because all the local environments characterizing the ice phases are
found in liquid water. The code walkthrough will use the Python code:
