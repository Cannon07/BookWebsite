Though simple fluid systems are well-understood from first-principles
theories, the scale of many real-world problems make directly solving
the underlying equations for many applications practically impossible
with current analytical techniques. Complex dynamics, such as turbulent
fluid flow, have proven resistant to easy theoretic analysis.

Computational fluid dynamics is a class of methods used to numerically
solve the Navier-Stokes equations, the set of non-linear, partial
differential equations that describe fluid flow. The solution takes the
form of a velocity vector field and scalar pressure field, used to
calculate total force on an object through integration of pressure and
viscous stresses. The equations for incompressible flow, given below,
include a mass balance (Eq.
[\[eqn:continuity\]](#eqn:continuity)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:continuity"\}) and a momentum balance (Eq.
[\[eqn:momentum\]](#eqn:momentum)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="eqn:momentum"\}). $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{eqn:continuity\}
\nabla \cdot u &=0 \\
\label\{eqn:momentum\}
\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial t\}+(u \cdot \nabla)u&=\frac\{\mu\}\{\rho\} \nabla^2 u-\frac\{1\}\{\rho\} \nabla P + f
\end\{aligned\}$$

The difficulty in finding a solution lies in the nature of the
non-linear advective term in the momentum balance, $(u \cdot \nabla)u$,
which tends to evolve large and unpredictable fluctuations from
infinitesimal disturbances, i.e. turbulence. Since directly resolving
turbulence is impractical with current computational power due to the
need for an extremely fine grid, there are a number of different models
used to predict turbulence with varying degrees of assumptions,
complexity, and computational cost.

Researchers have been developing methods to address the computational
burden of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for decades. Typical CFD
simulations reduce the size of the problem by introducing a new set of
filtered dynamical equations that are simpler to solve, such as by
removing a dimension of the problem by averaging time-fluctuations in
the case of RANS, or resolving only larger spatial scales as in LES. The
tradeoff is that the filtered equations introduce a closure problem,
whereby new equations, models, or surrogates are included to fully
define a solution. Naturally, modeling the unresolved degrees-of-freedom
brings some approximation error, which may be unsatisfactory for many
large-scale applications.

In this chapter, we introduce a few computational simplifications:
Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and
Detached Eddy Simulation (DES).[@norrby_2014; @cfd-online; @shaughnessy]

## Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes

RANS provides a relatively accurate averaged solution at a low
computational cost. In the steady-state RANS formulation, instantaneous
variables are rewritten in their Reynolds decomposition, which contains
an average term (overbar) and a fluctuating term (prime):

$$\begin\{aligned\}
u_i = \overline\{u_i\} + u_i'
\end\{aligned\}$$

We can plug the definition above into the Navier-Stokes momentum
equations (using Einstein notation to simplify equations)
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho\left[\frac\{\partial u_i\}\{\partial t\}+u_j\frac\{\partial u_i\}\{\partial x_j\}\right]&= -\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x_i\} +\frac\{\partial \tau_\{ij\}\}\{\partial x_j\}\\
\rho\left[\frac\{\partial (\overline\{u_i\} + u_i')\}\{\partial t\}+(\overline\{u_j\} + u_j')\frac\{\partial (\overline\{u_i\} + u_i')\}\{\partial x_j\}\right]&= -\frac\{\partial (\overline\{P\} + P')\}\{\partial x_i\} +\frac\{\partial (\overline\{\tau_\{ij\}\} + \tau_\{ij\}')\}\{\partial x_j\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

and averaging:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho\left[\frac\{\partial \overline\{u_i\}\}\{\partial t\}+\overline\{u_j\}\frac\{\partial \overline\{u_i\}\}\{\partial x_j\}\right]&= -\frac\{\partial \overline\{P\}\}\{\partial x_i\} +\frac\{\partial \overline\{\tau_\{ij\}\}\}\{\partial x_j\}-\rho\overline\{u_j'\frac\{\partial u_i'\}\{\partial x_j\}\}\\
\rho\left[\frac\{\partial \overline\{u_i\}\}\{\partial t\}+\overline\{u_j\}\frac\{\partial \overline\{u_i\}\}\{\partial x_j\}\right]&= -\frac\{\partial \overline\{P\}\}\{\partial x_i\} +\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial x_j\}\left(\overline\{\tau_\{ij\}\}-\rho\overline\{u_i'u_j'\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The quantity $-\rho\overline\{u_i'u_j'\}$ is termed the Reynolds stress
tensor. RANS methods close the problem using one or two more transport
equations to model the Reynolds stress tensor. We use the realizable
$k-\epsilon$ model, which relates the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ and
turbulent dissipation rate $\epsilon$.

## Large Eddy Simulations

Large eddy simulations provide a first mathematical model of turbulence.
Similar to RANS, the LES approaches apply a spatial smoothing filter to
the Navier-Stokes equations to gain smoothed models.

## Detached Eddy Simulation

The transient DES approach functions similarly to RANS, but results in
much higher-fidelity solutions. DES is a hybrid approach to turbulence
modeling and borrows from both RANS and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). In
LES, instead of time averaging the equations like RANS, the equations
are spatially filtered to remove the highest frequency fluctuations.
This results in directly resolving the larger scales of turbulence,
while modeling the smallest scales. DES combines the two by applying
RANS near the walls in the boundary layer and switching to LES further
away, somewhat relaxing grid requirements. Boundary layer behavior can
be estimated with RANS on a coarser grid rather than directly resolving
the flow with LES. The computational cost is higher than RANS, but not
quite as much as LES[@lectures].

In this chapter, we introduce additional machinery needed to understand
fluid dynamics, the sub-discipline of fluid mechanics that deals with
fluids (gases and liquids) in motion.

### Fluid Dynamics Modeling

Fluid dynamics offers a way to solve practical problems by providing a
systematic understanding of empirical and semi-empirical laws derived
from flow measurement. Empirical and semi-empirical laws are constituted
based on assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a
physical system, which can be expressed mathematically. Every fluid is
assumed to obey conservation of mass, momentum, energy and satisfies the
continuum assumption.

The assumption that mass is conserved simply means that for any fixed
control volume within the fluid, the rate of change of the mass
contained within the control volume (CV) is equal to the difference
between the rate of change of the mass entering the control volume,
$m_\{\mathrm\{in\}\}$, and the rate of change of the mass leaving the
control volume, $m_\{\mathrm\{out\}\}$, if no fluid is generated or consumed
inside the control volume. A mathematical expression for the same would
be:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{CV\}\}\}\{dt\}=\frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{in\}\}\}\{dt\}-\frac\{dm_\{\mathrm\{out\}\}\}\{dt\}+\mathrm\{production\ rate\}- \mathrm\{consumption\ rate\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ In a similar way, governing equations can be set up for
the conservation of energy and momentum.

The continuum assumption is an extension of continuum mechanics under
which fluids can be treated as continuous despite the fact that they are
composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic
properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and velocity are
taken to be well-defined at infinitesimal volume elements and computed
as average values of the molecular properties.

Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications such as fluid flow
modeling for aircraft and spacecraft design, determining the mass flow
rate of chemicals in industries, vascular stenting approaches to improve
blood flow, etc.

### Navier Stokes Equations

Fluid flow is typically modeled using the Navier--Stokes equations
(named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes), which are
differential equations that describe the force balance at a given point
within a fluid through changes in momentum (force) in response to
pressure $P$ and viscosity, parameterized by the kinematic viscosity
$\nu$. For an incompressible fluid with vector velocity field **u**, the
Navier--Stokes equations are $$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \{\frac \{\partial u \}\{\partial t\}\}+(u \cdot \nabla )u =-\{\frac \{1\}\{\rho \}\}\nabla P+\nu \nabla ^\{2\}u \}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations are obtained using calculus.
Practically, only the simplest cases of fluid flow, which generally
involve non-turbulent, steady flow (quantified by a low Reynolds
number), can be solved exactly. For more complex cases, especially those
involving turbulence, solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations can
currently only be computed through simulations, which constitutes the
field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Since the Reynolds number
is an important quantify in fluid dynamics, the following subsection
provides a brief description:

## Fluid Flow between Parallel Plates

![Poiseuille flow along parallel
plates.](figures/Physics/fluids/fluid_dynamics/Poiseuille flow.png)\{#fig:plateFlow
width="\\linewidth"\}

In this section, we solve a first simple fluid flow problem of flow
between two parallel plates. Flow occurs along the $x$ direction, the
$y$ direction is perpendicular to the plates, and $z$ is out of plane.
We recognize that independent of time, $$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_y &= 0 \\
    v_z &=0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Since there is no velocity in the $y$ and $z$ directions
we know that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial y\} =\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial z\} &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The continuity equation implies that
$\frac\{\partial v_x\}\{\partial x\}=0$, therefore $v_x=v_x(y)$.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    -\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} + \mu \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &= 0\\
    \frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} &= \mu \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, since $v_x$ is not a function of $x$, we have that
$\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}$ must equal a constant. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\} &= C_1 \\
    P &= C_1 x + C_2
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's now apply the boundary conditions. At $x=0$, $P=P_1$, hence
$C_2=P_1$. At $x=L$, $P=P_2$, hence $C_1=-\Delta P/L$, where
$\Delta P=P_1-P_2$. From the Navier-Stokes equation, we now have
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mu\frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &= C_1=-\Delta P/L \\
    \frac\{\partial^2 v_x\}\{\partial y^2\} &=-\frac\{\Delta P\}\{\mu L\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

$v_x$ can be written down as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_x &=-\frac\{\Delta P\}\{2 \mu L\}y^2+C_3 y+C_4 \\ 
    \frac\{\partial v_x\}\{\partial y\} &=  \frac\{\Delta P\}\{\mu L\} y +C_3
\end\{aligned\}$$

No slip conditions means that $C_3=0$ and
$C_4=\frac\{\Delta P d^2\}\{8 \mu L\}$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    v_x &= \frac\{\Delta P\}\{2 \mu L\}\left (\frac\{d^2\}\{4\}-y^2 \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Flow through a pipe

![Steady laminar flow in a long pipe with an applied pressure gradient
$\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}$ that is driving the fluid through the
pipe.
](figures/Physics/fluids/fluid_dynamics/Flowpipe_fluid.png)\{#fig:pipeFlow
width="100%"\}

Consider steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in an
infinitely long round pipe of diameter $D$ or radius $R=D/2$. Let's
ignore the effects of gravity. A constant pressure gradient
$\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}$ is applied in the $x$ direction,

The applied pressure gradient is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}=\frac\{P_2-P_1\}\{x_2-x_2\}= \textrm\{constant\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two arbitrary locations along the $x$ axis,
and $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the pressures at those two locations. Note that
we adopt a modified cylindrical coordinate system with $x$ instead of
$z$ for the axial component, names, $(r,\theta, x)$ and
$(u_r, u_\{\theta\},u)$. Let's derive an expression for the velocity field
inside the pipe.

We make a few assumptions that are valid in this case. First we assume
that the pipe is infinitely long in the $x$ direction. We also assume
that the flow is steady (all partial derivatives are zero) and that the
flow is parallel (no $r$ component of velocity, $u_r=0$).

We also assume the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian and with
constant properties, and the flow is laminar and that a
constant-pressure gradient is applied in the $x$ direction such that
pressure changes linearly with respect to $x$. We also assume the
velocity field is axisymmetric with no swirl, implying that
$u_\{\theta\}=0$ and all partial derivatives with respect to $\theta$ are
zero. Finally, we ignore the effects of gravity.

The following are the boundary conditions for this problem: First, a no
slip condition at the wall $$\begin\{aligned\}
\textrm\{At \}r=R, \quad \vec\{V\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Second, the centerline of the pipe is an axis of symmetry
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\textrm\{At \}r=o, \quad \frac\{du\}\{dr\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$

Let's write down the differential equations from the Navier-Stokes
relations. Incompressible continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates
can be written as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{\partial(r u_r)\}\{\partial r\}+\frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{u_\{\theta\}\}\{\partial \theta\}+\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}=0 \implies \frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}=0
\end\{aligned\}$$ since the first two terms are zero given the
corresponding assumptions. This equation implies that $u$ is not a
function of $x$. Furthermore, from our assumptions, $u$ is neither a
function of time or $\theta$, therefore, we conclude that $u$ is at most
a function of $r$: $u=u(r)$.

Let's write down the axial momentum equation and apply cancellations
from our assumptions.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho \bigg( \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial t\}\} +\cancelto\{\}\{u\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial r\}\}+\cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{u_\{\theta\}\}\{r\}\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial \theta\}\}+\cancelto\{\}\{u\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial x\}\}\bigg)=-\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}+\cancelto\{\}\{\rho g\} + \mu\bigg( \frac\{1\}\{r\} \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial r\} (r\frac\{\partial u\}\{\partial r\}) + \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{1\}\{r^2\} \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial \theta^2\}\}+ \cancelto\{\}\{\frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial x^2\}\}\bigg)    
\end\{aligned\}$$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
\implies \frac\{1\}\{r\}\frac\{d\}\{dr\}\bigg(r\frac\{du\}\{dr\}\bigg)=\frac\{1\}\{\mu\}\frac\{\partial P\}\{\partial x\}    
\label\{eq:pipe\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since $P$ is only a function of $x$ from the $r$-momentum equations in a
very similar manner to the axial momentum equation, the partial
derivative term can be replaced by a total derivative operator in eqn.
[\[eq:pipe\]](#eq:pipe)\{reference-type="ref" reference="eq:pipe"\}:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    r\frac\{du\}\{dr\}=\frac\{r^2\}\{2\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_1
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Note that the
pressure gradient is a constant here. Integrating again, we get

$$\begin\{aligned\}
u=\frac\{r^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_1 \mathrm\{ln\}\ r+C_2
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $C_2$ is another constant of integration.

Applying boundary condition 2, we get $C_1=0$. Applying boundary
condition 2, $$\begin\{aligned\}
    u=\frac\{R^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}+C_2=0 \implies C_2=-\frac\{R^2\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the axial velocity can be written down as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    u=\frac\{1\}\{4\mu\}\frac\{dP\}\{dx\}(r^2-R^2)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The velocity profile is thus in the shape of a paraboloid.


# The Reynolds Number and Turbulent Flow \{#chap:reynolds\}

Turbulent flow, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exhibits
significant multi-scale behavior that critically makes direct simulation
difficult. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of fluid flow must resolve
the smallest scales of the flow, which are orders of magnitude smaller
than the characteristic dimensions of the flow. The computational cost
of direct simulation is high, making it impractical for applications
like vehicle aerodynamics, climate modeling, or astrophysics, and is
thus limited to simple flow configurations which are typically
oversimplified for general engineering or geophysical applications.

## The Reynolds Number

The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics
used to help predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations.
At low Reynolds numbers, fluid flow is dominated by laminar flow, while
at high Reynolds numbers fluid flow is turbulent, resulting from
differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may cross each
other or move in a direction opposite to the overall flow direction
leading to eddy currents.

The Reynolds number is calculated as the ratio of inertial forces to
viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal
movement due to different fluid velocities. Relative movement within a
fluid generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing
turbulent flow, while the viscosity of the fluid counteracts the effect
and inhibits turbulence. The Reynolds number quantifies the interplay
between these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and
provides a way to understand when turbulent flow will occur. A more
precise distinction between low Reynolds number flow and high Reynolds
number flow is that at low Reynolds numbers, viscous forces are
dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion, whereas
at high Reynolds numbers, turbulent flow occurs dominated by inertial
forces, which tend to produce eddies, vortices and other flow
instabilities. The Reynolds number is defined as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \mathrm \{Re\} =\{\frac \{\rho uD\}\{\mu \}\}=\{\frac \{uD\}\{\nu \}\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $u$ is the flow speed, $D$ is the diameter of the tube, $\mu$ is
the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\rho$ and $\nu$ are same quantities
as in the Navier Stokes equations.

### Turbulence Modeling

The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, which are
time-averaged equations of motion for fluid flow, are primarily used to
describe turbulent flows. The core idea behind the RANS equations is the
decomposition of an instantaneous quantity into its time-averaged and
fluctuating quantities, which was originally proposed by Osborne
Reynolds. For a stationary flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid,
these equations can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\displaystyle \rho \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{j\}\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{i\}\}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}=\rho \{\bar \{f\}\}_\{i\}+\{\frac \{\partial \}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}\left[-\{\bar \{p\}\}\delta _\{ij\}+\mu \left(\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{i\}\}\{\partial x_\{j\}\}\}+\{\frac \{\partial \{\bar \{u\}\}_\{j\}\}\{\partial x_\{i\}\}\}\right)-\rho \{\overline \{u_\{i\}^\{\prime \}u_\{j\}^\{\prime \}\}\}\right].\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where the time-average operator $\overline \{.\}$ is a Reynolds operator.
The left hand side of the RANS equation represents the change in mean
momentum of the fluid element due to the unsteadiness in the mean flow
and the convection by the mean flow. The change in mean momentum is
balanced by the mean body force, the isotropic stress owing to the mean
pressure field, the viscous stresses, and apparent stress
$\left(-\rho \{\overline \{u_\{i\}^\{\prime \}u_\{j\}^\{\prime \}\}\}\right)$ owing
to the fluctuating velocity field, generally referred to as the Reynolds
stress. The Reynolds stress is a non-linear term that requires
additional modeling to close the RANS equation for solving, and has led
to the creation of many different turbulence models.


# Introduction to Plasmas \{#chap:plasma_physics\}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prerequisites:**
[\[chap:newtons_laws\]](#chap:newtons_laws)\{reference-type="ref+label"
reference="chap:newtons_laws"\}\
**Difficulty Level:** \*\*\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, we will study the behavior of plasmas, one of the
fundamental states of matter. Plasmas, are gases of ions and free
electrons. Plasmas arise in a number of physical systems of interest,
such as stars and lightning, and are also of critical interest for
industrial processes such as chip manufacturing and fusion.

## Qualitative Properties of Plasma

Plasmas are electrically conducting since they consist of a gas of
ionized particles. As a result, the techniques of fluid mechanics
combined with those of electromagnetism prove powerful tools for
modeling plasma behavior.

The degree of ionization $\alpha$ is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\alpha = \frac\{n_i\}\{n_i + n_n\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n_i$ is the number density of ions and $n_n$ is the number
density of neutral atoms.

## Magnetohydrodynamics

Magnetohydrodynamics is one of the standard techniques for
mathematically modelling plasmas. This model combines elements of the
Navier-Stokes equations with Maxwell's equations to create a continuum
model of the plasma as a type of electrically charged fluid.

In this section, we will introduce the core equations of
magnetohydrodynamics. Let's start with a continuity equation

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial \rho\}\{\partial t\} + \nabla \cdot (\rho v) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Cauchy momentum equation is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho \left ( \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} + v \cdot \nabla  \right ) v &= J \times B - \nabla p 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Using the identity

$$\frac\{1\}\{2\} \nabla (B \cdot B) = (B \cdot \nabla) B + B \times (\nabla \times B)$$

### Magnetohydrodynamic Waves

## Vlasov Equation

An alternative model of plasmas is to model them as a large collection
of individual particles moving in the presence of an electromagnetic
field.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d f(r, p, t)\}\{dt\} &= 0 \\
    \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial t\} + \frac\{d r\}\{d t\} \cdot \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial r\} + \frac\{d p\}\{d t\}\cdot \frac\{\partial f\}\{\partial p\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Vlasov equations add a self-consistent field created by the charged
plasma particles. The theory introduces two distribution functions

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f_e(r, p, t) &= 0 \\
    f_i(r, p , t) &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ that model the density of electrons and positive ions
respectively. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial f_e\}\{\partial t\}+ v_e \cdot \nabla f_e - e \left (E + \frac\{v_e\}\{c\} \times B \right) \cdot \frac\{\partial f_e\}\{\partial p\} &= 0 \\
    \frac\{\partial f_i\}\{\partial t\}+ v_i \cdot \nabla f_i - Z_i e \left (E + \frac\{v_i\}\{c\} \times B \right) \cdot \frac\{\partial f_i\}\{\partial p\} &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here $E$ and $B$ are the self consistent electrical and
magnetic fields created by the system.

## Plasma Confinement

Since plasmas are electrically charged, it becomes possible to confine
them with magnetic fields. This property of plasmas is very useful for
building prototype fusion reactors which need to confine high
temperature plasmas to facilitate conditions for fusion.
