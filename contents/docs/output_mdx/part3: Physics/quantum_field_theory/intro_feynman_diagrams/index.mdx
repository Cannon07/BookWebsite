In this chapter, we introduce the basics of Feynman diagrams, a powerful
technology for modeling relativistic quantum processes. Feynman diagrams
provide conceptual models for complex interacting quantum processes. In
this chapter we introduce the basic theory of Feynman diagrams and
Feynman rules as a mathematical technique for evaluating integrals
before briefly explaining how these techniques can be used for more
complex physical systems.

## Feynman Diagrams for Evaluating Integrals

In this section, we use Feynman diagrams to evaluate an integral.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + b q^4 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

The presence of the quartic term means that we can't directly evaluate
this integral using techniques we've developed for evaluating Gaussian
integrals. One possibility for removing the quartic term is to expand it
out as a Taylor series:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    e^\{bq^4\} &= 1 + bq^4 + \frac\{b^2q^8\}\{2!\} + \frac\{b^2q^\{12\}\}\{3!\} + \dotsc
\end\{aligned\}$$

Plugging this expansion back into the earlier expression yield

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + b q^4 + cq\} dq
    &= \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a q^2 + cq\} \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n q^\{4n\}\}\{n!\} \right ] dq \\
    &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} q^\{4n\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$ We note that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d\}\{dc\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= q e^\{aq^2 + cq\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Repeating the derivative, we obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d^2\}\{dc\} d^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= \frac\{d\}\{dc\} (qe^\{aq^2 + cq\}) \\
    &= q \frac\{d\}\{dc\} (e^\{aq^2 + cq\}) \\
    &= q^2 e^\{aq^2 + cq\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ We see now that we can iterate as many times as desired
to obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} &= q^\{4n\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then differentiate through the integral sign
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} q^\{4n\}e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

Returning to the expression above, we obtain that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + bq^4 + cq\} dq &= \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \frac\{d^\{4n\}\}\{dc^\{4n\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\}\left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n\right ] \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$

Note that above, we are treating $\frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}$ as an linear
operator and taking its exponential. To tackle the inner integral, we
complete the square in the exponential. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{a\left (q^2 + \frac\{c\}\{a\}q + \frac\{c^2\}\{4a^2\}\right ) - \frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} dq \\
    &= e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}\int_\{-\infty\}^\infty e^\{a\left (q + \frac\{c\}\{2a\}\right )^2 \} dq
\end\{aligned\}$$ We apply the change of variable $r = q + \frac\{c\}\{2a\}$.
Note then that $dr = dq$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &=
    e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{ar^2\} dr
\end\{aligned\}$$ Applying the formula for the Gaussian integral we obtain
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{ar^2\} dr &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ It follows that $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq &= e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\} \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We then substitute this expression into the earlier
operator evaluation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{aq^2 + cq\} dq \\
    &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} e^\{b \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\} \left [ e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}  \right ]
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's pause here and take stock of what we've achieved.
We've rewritten our original integral as the application of a linear
operator in $c$, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}e^\{b\frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\},
\end\{aligned\}$$ to a function in $c$, $e^\{-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\}\}$. What's the
advantage of this representation? Computing this quantity outright isn't
straightforward. However, we have two exponential quantities, and we can
expand both as power series to obtain a representation of $Z$ as a power
series in two indices $n$, $m$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \left [ \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \frac\{b^n\}\{n!\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\} \right )^n \right ] \left [
     \sum_\{m=0\}^\infty \frac\{\left(-\frac\{c^2\}\{4a\} \right )^m\}\{m!\} \right ] \\
     &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \sum_\{n=0\}^\infty \sum_\{m=0\}^\infty \frac\{b^n(-1)^m\}\{n!m!(4a)^m\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n c^\{2m\} \\
     &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\} \sum_\{n=0\}^\{\infty\} \sum_\{m=0\}^\{\infty\} Z_\{n,m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Here we define intermediate quantities $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{n, m\} &= \frac\{b^n(-1)^m\}\{n!m!(4a)^m\} \left ( \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\}\right )^n c^\{2m\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Note that these $Z_\{n,m\}$ are no longer functions and
are numbers! For example, we take $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{3, 2\} &= \frac\{b^3\}\{3!2!(4a)^2\} \frac\{d^\{12\}\}\{dc^\{12\}\} c^4 \\
    &= \frac\{b^3\}\{3!2!4^2 a^2\} (4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \dotsc \cdot -8) \frac\{1\}\{c^8\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ While we don't have an analytical expression for $Z$, we
can evaluate any $Z_\{n,m\}$ term. We can then do a series expansion out
to any $N$, $M$ we desire as follows: $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \tilde\{Z\} &= \sqrt\{-\frac\{\pi\}\{a\}\}\sum_\{n=0\}^N \sum_\{m=0\}^M Z_\{n,m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Each $Z_\{n, m\}$ can be viewed as a combinatorial object in its own
right. To understand what this means, consider the manipulations

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z_\{1, 4\} &= \frac\{b(-1)^4\}\{4!4^4a^4\} \frac\{d^4\}\{dc^4\} c^8 \\ 
    &= \frac\{b(-1)^4\}\{4!4^4a^4\} (8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5) c^4 \\
    &= \frac\{8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5\}\{4!4^4\} \frac\{(-1)^4bc^4\}\{a^4\} \\
    &= \binom\{8\}\{4\} \frac\{(-1)^4bc^4\}\{4^4a^4 \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The presence of the choose operation suggests that there
are discrete objects underlying $Z_\{n,m\}$. What could these objects be?
Let's start by looking at the coefficients for $a$, $b$, $c$. Note that
$Z_\{1,4\}$ contains $b$, $\frac\{1\}\{a^4\}$, $c^4$ as its coefficient
powers. Can we construct a discrete object that contains these
coefficients? For example, consider the following diagram.\

Here we have two lines intersecting at a vertex. The inputs to the lines
are labeled with $c$ coefficients. The vertex is labeled with $b$
coefficients and the line segments with $\frac\{1\}\{a\}$ coefficients. If
we multiply all these coefficients, we can consider them as contributing
a term $\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$. More abstractly, we can think of $Z_\{1,4\}$ as
counting contributions from all diagrams which are made of 4 lines and
one vertex. For example, consider this alternative diagram where there
is a loop at the vertex and one line as an unconnected component. Note
that this diagram contributes the same term $\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$.\

We can view these simple diagrams as simple Feynman diagrams for our
system. By enumerating all the diagrams that provide a term
$\frac\{bc^4\}\{a^4\}$ according to our rules, we could obtain the
coefficient for this term in our power series. We know from the
calculation above that the coefficient is $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \{8 \choose 4\}\frac\{(-1)^4\}\{4^4\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We leave as an exercise for the reader how to obtain
this coefficient from the two diagrams above.

## Exercises

1.  Evaluate the term $Z_\{4, 3\}$ for $a=-3$, $b=2$, $c=1$.

2.  Derive a double series expansion for the integral $$\begin\{aligned\}
        Z = \int_\{-\infty\}^\{\infty\} e^\{-aq^2 + bq^7 + cq\} dq
    \end\{aligned\}$$
