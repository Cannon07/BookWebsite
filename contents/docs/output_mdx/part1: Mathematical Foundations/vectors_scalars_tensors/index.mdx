A scalar is a term for an element of a field. For example, if
$a \in \mathbb\{R\}$, we might refer to $a$ as a scalar. A *vector space*
is a set $V$ that satisfies the following properties.

1.  Scalar Multiplication: Let $F$ be a field. Let $a \in F$ be a
    scalar. If $v$ is a vector, then $av$ is a vector. The operation
    mapping $v$ to $av$ is called scalar multiplication.

2.  Linear Combination: If $u, v \in V$ and $a, b \in F$, then
    $au + bv \in V$.

$\mathbb\{R\}^2$ provides a simple example of a vector space. We define
scalar multiplication and addition as follows $$\begin\{aligned\}
    c(a, b) &= (ca, cb) \\
    (a, b) + (c, d) &= (a+c, b+d)
\end\{aligned\}$$

A *vector* is an element of a vector space. A vector is a geometric
object. A vector is said to be of dimension $n$ if there exist $n$
elements $e_1,\cdots,e_n \in V$ (read as \"e one to e n in v\") such
that given any element $v \in V$, we can write
$$v = a_1 e_1 + \cdots + a_n e_n,$$ for some choice of $a_i \in F$. The
elements $e_i$ are said to constitute a *basis* for $V$. Note that not
all vector spaces have a finite basis; we'll run into *Hilbert spaces*
when we discuss quantum mechanics that are infinite dimensional vector
spaces.

A common example of a vector space operation is to perform a \"change of
basis\". That is, we want to swap from basis $e_1, \dotsc, e_n$ to new
basis $h_1, \dotsc, h_n$. The idea for this is simple; simply rewrite
each $e_i$ in terms of $h_i$.

$$e_i = b_\{i1\} h_1 + \dotsc + b_\{in\} h_n$$

Then substitute these back any basis expansion in terms of the $e_i$.

### Inner Product Space

A vector space is called an inner product space if there exists a
function $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle \cdot | \cdot \rangle: V \times V \to F
\end\{aligned\}$$ (read as \"anonymous function that takes two vectors in
v to a scalar in f\"). $\mathbb\{R\}^2$ has a dot product defined as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle (a, b) | (c, d) \rangle &= ac + bd
\end\{aligned\}$$ Another common alternative notation for the inner
producct is the transpose notation $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \langle v | w \rangle &= v^T w
\end\{aligned\}$$ (read as \"v transpose w\").

### Dual Space

For every vector space $V$ over field $F$, we can define an associated
vector space $V^*$ denoted the dual space as follows
$$V^* = \{ \varphi: V \to F \ | \ \varphi \textrm\{ is linear\}\}$$ The
pipe $|$ is read as \"such that.\" The entire definition above is read
as \"V star equals the set of phi from V to F such that phi is linear.\"

Here, we define a function $f$ to be linear if it respects combinations
in $V$. That is $$f(au + bv) = af(u) + bf(v)$$

The dual space arises very naturally in linear algebra since each
element $v \in V$ induces an element in the dual space by the inner
product $$\begin\{aligned\}
    w \mapsto v^T w
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Tensor Product

Let $V$ and $W$ be two vector spaces. The operation $\otimes$, denoted
the tensor product, is a way of combining the two vector spaces into one
larger vector space denoted $V \otimes W$. If $d_1,\dotsc, d_n$ is a
basis for $V$ and $e_1,\dotsc,e_m$ is a basis for $W$, then the basis
for $V \otimes W$ is of size $nm$ and has basis elements
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    d_1 \otimes e_1, \dotsc, d_n \otimes e_m 
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Tensors

Let $V$ be a vectors space over $F$. Let $V^*$ be its dual vector space.
A tensor on the vector space $V$ is defined to be an element of
$$V \otimes \cdots \otimes V \otimes V^* \otimes \cdots \otimes V^*$$ If
there are $p$ copies of $V$ and $q$ copies of $V^*$ we say that the
tensor is of type $(p, q)$. Like a vector, a tensor is a geometric
object that doesn't depend on a choice of basis for $V$. Given a choice
of basis on $V$, it is possible represent a tensor as a multidimensional
array.

### Scalar, Vector, and Array Notation

For a lot of our mathematical work, we'll use in the set of real
numbers, which we denote $\mathbb\{R\}$. Scalars are members of
$\mathbb\{R\}$ or $\mathbb\{C\}$ and will be denoted using lowercase letters
$x, y, z, \dotsc$. Vectors are represented as elements of $\mathbb\{R\}^N$
for $N > 1$. We will denote vectors generally as
$\vec\{u\}, \vec\{v\}, \vec\{w\}$ with the overhead notation. We will follow
the convention that vectors are column vectors

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \vec\{u\} = \begin\{bmatrix\}
           u_\{1\} \\
           u_\{2\} \\
           \vdots \\
           u_\{N\}
         \end\{bmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Matrices are elements of $\mathbb\{R\}^\{N \times M\}$ and will be denoted
with capital letters $X, Y, Z, \dotsc$. We will write

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    X = \begin\{bmatrix\}
    X_\{11\} & \cdots & X_\{1M\} \\
    X_\{21\} & \cdots & X_\{2M\} \\
           & \vdots & \\
    X_\{N1\}&  \cdots& X_\{NM\} \\
    \end\{bmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

We will sometimes have to work with multidimensional arrays, such as
elements of $\mathbb\{R\}^\{L \times N \times M\}$. We will use the same
notation to refer to multidimensional arrays as we do to matrices (and
trust that context will disambiguate which is which). Let
$T \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{L \times N \times M \}$. We will write $T$ as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
T = \begin\{bmatrix\}
    \begin\{bmatrix\}
    T_\{111\} &\cdots  & T_\{11M\} \\
    T_\{121\} & \cdots & T_\{12M\} \\
            & \vdots & \\
    T_\{1N1\} & \cdots & T_\{1NM\} \\
    \end\{bmatrix\}
    & \cdots &
    \begin\{bmatrix\}
    T_\{L11\} & \cdots & T_\{L1M\} \\
    T_\{L21\} & \cdots & T_\{L2M\} \\
            & \vdots & \\
    T_\{LN1\} & \cdots & T_\{LNM\} \\
    \end\{bmatrix\}
    \end\{bmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Exercises

1.  Let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. Prove that $V^*$ is a vector
    space by showing that it obeys the vector space laws.

2.  Prove that if $f,g :[a, b] \to \mathbb\{R\}$ are continuous functions
    and $c, d \in \mathbb\{R\}$, then $cf + gd$ is a continuous function.
