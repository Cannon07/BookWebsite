Electronic structure theory is the computational investigation of
electron distribution. Bad scaling for traditional electronic structure
calculations. It is useful to use machine learning to accelerate
simulations.

We can define an entropy term with electron temperature $\tau_e$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    A[n] &= E_H[n] + E_\{ei\}[n] +T_s[\phi_j[n]] +E_\{xc\}[n] -k_B\tau_eS_s[\epsilon_j[n]]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Higher temperatures means more orbitals need to be considered. We can
compute the local density of states

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    d(\epsilon, r) &= \sum_j |\phi_j(r)|^2 \delta(\epsilon - \epsilon_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Ionic densities are represented using bispectrum descriptors
$B(r, j)[R_\{cut\}, j_\{max\}]$. A vector of bispectrum descriptors is then
fed into a fully connected neural network to make predictions.

The system is tested on reproducing the electronic structure of aluminum
at room temperature. Also we study the models at the melting phase of
aluminum. The system is also tested with size transfer. The system
appears to scale up to hundreds of thousands of atoms.
