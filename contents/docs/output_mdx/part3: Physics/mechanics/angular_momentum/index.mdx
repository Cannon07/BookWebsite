In this chapter, we study the basics of angular momentum. Angular
momentum is a quantity, akin to the momentum we have learned about
already, but which arises in rotating systems.

## Defining Angular Momentum

When defining angular momentum, we will find it useful to start by
defining the center of mass. Suppose that we have $n$ particles with
masses $m_1,\dotsc, m_n$ at positions $r_1,\dotsc,r_n$. We define the
center of mass of this system to be $$\begin\{aligned\}
    r_\{\textrm\{cent\}\} &= \frac\{\sum_\{i=1\}^n m_i r_i\}\{\sum_\{i=1\}^n m_i\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ For a contiguous body, we would have to convert this
equation into an integral. Let us now let $r$ define the position of a
particle relative to the origin. Then we can define the angular momentum
as

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    L &= r \times p
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $p$ is the linear momentum. We can write down a dimensional type
equation for angular momentum

        [L] = [M][L]$^2$[T]$^\{-1\}$

We will find it useful for our later discussion of quantum mechanics to
define spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. Spin angular
momentum is the angular momentum arising from rotation around the center
of mass $r_c$ of an object, while orbital angular momentum arises from
rotation around a central point of rotation denoted as the origin. A
planet orbiting the sun has both spin and orbital angular momentum for
example.

We next define the torque $\tau$ as the rate of change of angular
momentum $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{dL\}\{dt\} &= \tau
\end\{aligned\}$$
