In this chapter, we introduce a number of symmetry groups that arise in
physical systems. All the groups we introduce here are examples of
topological groups, where they inherit a topological structure from a
larger space (typically $\mathbb\{R\}^n$ or $\mathbb\{R\}^\{n \times n\}$). In
fact, as we will learn in a later chapter, these groups also inherit a
differentiable structure from the larger space, making them all examples
of \"Lie Groups\" (or differentiable groups).

## The Orthogonal Groups $O(N)$

The orthogonal group $O(3)$ is the collection of matrices with
orthogonal columns in $R^3$. More general, $O(N)$ is the collection of
$N \times N$ matrices which have orthogonal columns.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
O(N) &= \{ Q \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{N \times N\} | Q^T Q = QQ^T = I\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## The Rotation Groups $SO(N)$

The rotation group $SO(3)$ is the collection of three dimensional
rotations, and is denoted $\textrm\{SO\}(3)$. $SO(3)$ is related to $O(3)$
since it is the subset of $O(3)$ with determinant $1$. Mathematically,
we say that $\det$ is a homomorphism from $O(3)$ to the real numbers
minus $0$. $$\begin\{aligned\}
\det : O(N) \to \mathbb\{R\} \setminus \{0 \}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This fact holds since we have that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\det(AB) &= \det A \det B
\end\{aligned\}$$ $SO(3)$ is the subset of $O(3)$ that maps to $1$ under
this transformation. An alternative way of describing $SO(3)$ is that it
is the collection of orthogonal matrices whose columns are orthonormal
(and not just orthogonal).

All elements of $SO(3)$ are length preserving since rotations don't
change the length of vectors. This holds true more generally for $SO(N)$
and can be shown using the fact that column vectors are orthonormal.
Another important fact is that rotations are linear. That is, if $R$ is
a rotation and $u$ and $v$ are vectors, we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
R \cdot (u + v) &= R \cdot u + R \cdot v
\end\{aligned\}$$ For this reason, $SO(3)$ can be identified with the
collection of real valued $3x3$ matrices with unit determinant.

## The Euclidean Group $E(N)$

The Euclidean group $E(n)$ denotes all the distance preserving
transformations (isometries) on $\mathbb\{R\}^n$. This collection includes
all translations, rotations, and reflections. The group $E(3)$ commonly
arises when considering point clouds or collections of atoms in a
molecule or material.

## The Galilean Group

The Galilean group consists of the collection of transformations between
two reference frames which only differ by constant relative motion with
respect to one another. Consider $(x, t)$ where $x \in \mathbb\{R\}^3$ is
a coordinate and $t \in \mathbb\{R\}$ is time. Then uniform motion is
represented by the transformation $$\begin\{aligned\}
(x, t) \mapsto (x + tv, t)
\end\{aligned\}$$ Rotation is represented by the transformation
$$\begin\{aligned\}
(x, t) \mapsto (R x, t)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $R$ is a rotation matrix. Translations are
represented by $$\begin\{aligned\}
(x, t) \mapsto (x + v, t + s)
\end\{aligned\}$$ The group of Galilean transformations consists of all
the compositions of these three types of transformations.

## The Lorentz Group $O(1, 3)$

The Lorentz group is the group of all Lorentz transformations defined on
Minkowski space. Many fundamental equations in physics are invariant
under Lorentz transformations. Mathematically, we write the Lorentz
group as $O(1, 3)$ the set of orthogonal transformations on
$\mathbb\{R\}^4$ that preserve the quadratic form $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (t, x, y, z) \mapsto t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Lorentz group is often studied through its Lie group
$\mathfrak\{so\}(1, 3)$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathfrak\{so\}(1, 3) &= \{ X \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{4 \times 4\} | e^\{tX\} \in SO(1, 3), t \in \mathbb\{R\} \}
\end\{aligned\}$$
