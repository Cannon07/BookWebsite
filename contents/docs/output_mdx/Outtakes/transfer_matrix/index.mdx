[TODO: This is mainly notes from Shankar. May or or may not want to turn
into full chapter]\{style="color: red"\} Consider a 1-dimensional Ising
model $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z = \sum_\{s_i\} \prod_i e^\{K(s_i s_\{i+1\}-1)\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We define the transfer matrix as follows
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    T_\{s's\} &= e^\{K(s's-1)\} \\
    T &= \begin\{pmatrix\}
    1 & e^\{-2K\} \\ 
    e^\{-2K\} & 1 \\
    \end\{pmatrix\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can rewrite partition function $Z$ in terms of
transfer matrix $T$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= \sum_\{s_1=1,\dotsc,N-1\} T_\{s_Ns_\{N-1\}\}\dotsc T_\{s_2s_2\}T_\{s_1s_0\} \\
    &= \langle s_N | T^N s_0 \rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$ In the case that we have periodic boundary conditions
where $s_0 = s_N$, we then obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    Z &= \mathrm\{Tr\} T^N
\end\{aligned\}$$

[TODO: Shankar has a lot of description of the Perron-Frobenius
decomposition. Worth covering? Also, should this identity be
derived?]\{style="color: red"\}

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    T &= e^\{K*\sigma_1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ If you add a magnetic field $h$ to the Ising model, then
you get $$\begin\{aligned\}
    T&= e^\{K*sigma_1\}e^\{h\sigma_3\} \\
    &= T_K T_h
\end\{aligned\}$$

### The Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian $H$ is defined as below $$\begin\{aligned\}
    T &= e^\{-H\}\\
    H &= -K^* \sigma_1
\end\{aligned\}$$

### Discussion

[TODO: We may want to discuss how the transfer matrix can act as a
bridge between the partition function and quantum mechanical systems. I
don't fully get this myself yet.]\{style="color: red"\}
