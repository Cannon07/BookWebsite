Spectroscopy is one of the fundamental techniques used for materials
characterization, and studies the interaction between matter and
electromagnetic radiation. The physics of spectroscopy is governed by
the interaction between light and matter.

## The Interaction of Light and Matter

Matter is composed of atoms or molecules, and often has infinitely many
energy eigenstates. Spectral lines are associated with allowed
transitions between two of these energy eigenstates. From a physical
perspective, it is often sufficient to take only two of the possible
energy eigenstates into account.

An example worth discussing is laser transition, where the pumping of
the laser can be described by a relaxation process into the upper laser
level and out of the lower laser level. The resulting model is simple,
often referred to as a two-level atom, and is mathematically analogous
to a spin $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$ particle in an external magnetic field. This is
due to the fact that the spin can only be parallel or anti-parallel to
the field -- it has two energy levels and energy eigenstates. The
interaction of the two-level atom with the electric field of an
electromagnetic wave is described by the Bloch equations.

## Diffraction

Consider a collection of $N$ particles in a material. To probe distances
at the angstrom range, we would irradiate the sample with X-rays or
neutrons; our discussion will assume X-ray scattering. A beam with
wavelength $\lambda$ illuminates the sample. The incident beam is
coherent, *i.e.* all photons are in-phase. Due to a difference between
the refractive index of the particles and their surroundings, each
particle acts as a scattering center

Compare the pathlengths for scattering from 2 different particles. The
position of the $i$th and $j$th particles are located at $\vec\{r\}_i$ and
$\vec\{r\}_j$, respectively. The difference in the pathlength of the 2
photons in Fig.Â [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}
is given by the difference between lengths $B$ and $A$, since these are
the only segments that differ between the two photons.

Define the incident wavevector: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\}_0 &= \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction of the solution, and $\vec\{u\}_0$ is
a unit vector that defines the direction of the incident light.
Similarly, define the scattered wavevector:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\}_s = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_s
\end\{aligned\}$$

The fixed detector orientation relative to the source is defined by the
angle $\theta$.

Using these definitions, the two lengths $B$ and $A$ are given:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
B &= (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_s \\
A &= (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The pathlength difference is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
B - A = (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot (\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This results in a phase difference given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\phi_\{ij\} &= \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(B - A) = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0) \cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the scattering vector $\vec\{q\}$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\} = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

whose magnitude is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
q = |\vec\{q\}| = \frac\{4\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\sin\left(\frac\{\theta\}\{2\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

We have $$\begin\{aligned\}
\phi_\{ij\} = \vec\{q\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The electric field of light scattered by the $i$th particle relative to
the phase of light scattered by the $k$th particle is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq16\}
E_i = E_0C \cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi _\{ik\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the frequency, $E_0$ is the amplitude of the incident
electric field, and $C$ incorporates a number of experiment-specific
parameters (*e.g.* distance to detector, wavelength, polarizability).
The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the total
electric field squared. The average scattering intensity $I_s$ is given
by the intensity averaged over a complete oscillation period and is
given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq17\}
I_s &= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt\left[ \sum_\{i=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}) \right]^2 \notag\\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\})\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{jk\}) \notag\\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N[\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\}) + \cos(\phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

which makes use of the property:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\cos A \cos B = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos(A + B) + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos (A- B)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Noting that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq19\}
\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\}) =0
\end\{aligned\}$$

and, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq20\}
\phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\} = \phi_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

we have, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
I_s &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos\phi_\{ij\} \notag\\
 &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Measuring $I_s$ at zero scattering angle ($\theta = 0$) gives the
unknown parameters $I_0$ and $A$. Therefore,

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the structure factor $S(\vec\{k\})$ to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
S(\vec\{k\}) = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N \bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j) \right] \bigg\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

we can write:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = Re[S(\vec\{q\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Rotational invariance gives $S(\vec\{k\}) = S(-\vec\{k\})$, thus:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = S(\vec\{q\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Expand the structure factor into $i = j$ and $i \neq j$. This gives:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
S(\vec\{k\}) & = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N(N-1)\bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2) \right] \bigg\rangle \notag\\
& = \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\frac\{N(N-1)\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\}e^\{-\beta U\}\}\{\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{-\beta U\}\}\notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\rho^2g(r_\{12\})e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N\}\rho \int d\vec\{r\}g(r)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}\} = N^\{-1\} + N^\{-1\}\rho\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\}) \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\})$ is the Fourier transform of $g(\vec\{k\})$.
This demonstrates that the results of a scattering experiment give a
direct measure of the pair distribution of the particles in a material.
