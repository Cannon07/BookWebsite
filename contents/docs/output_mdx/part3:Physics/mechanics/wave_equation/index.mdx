The wave equation is the fundamental mathematical model for travelling
waves. The equation can be used to model physical waves on a rope,
electromagnetic waves, and even solutions to quantum field theories.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial t^2\} &= c^2 \left ( \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial x_1^2\} + \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial x_2^2\} + \dotsc + \frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial x_n^2\}  \right )
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can simplify this expression to $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial t^2\} &= c^2 \nabla^2 u
\end\{aligned\}$$ The wave equation is our first example of a hyperbolic
differential equation. Hyperbolic equations have a propagation speed
(here $c$) that their solutions must obey.

## Solving the Wave Equation

We perform a change of variable to $$\begin\{aligned\}
\xi &= x - ct \\
\eta &= x + ct
\end\{aligned\}$$

Under this change of variable, the wave equation transforms to
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{\partial^2 u\}\{\partial \xi \partial \eta\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ This equation follows the separated form we studied
earlier, so we can write the general solution as $$\begin\{aligned\}
u(\xi, \eta) &= F(\xi) + G(\eta)
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $F$ and $G$ are arbitrary functions. Changing
variables back we can write $$\begin\{aligned\}
u(x, t) &= F(x-ct) + G(y+ct)
\end\{aligned\}$$ $F$ can be viewed as a right-traveling wave and $G$ as a
left-traveling wave.
