Ray tracing is a powerful computer graphics technique for rendering
visual scenes by tracking the paths of light rays across a scene and
rendering its interactions with different materials.

![A Conceptual Representation of ray tracing

A light source here is assumed to be a point source of light located at
some position $(x, y, z)$.

Conceptually, the ray tracing algorithm works by tracing the path of
light from the eye and then computing the intersection between the light
ray and objects in the image itself. Note that computing intersection
with objects in a scene can be quite complex since objects may be
represented by complex geometric objects.

## Basic Mathematical Framework

Suppose that the position of the eye is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
E \in \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let the target position be given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
T \in \mathbb\{R\}^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let $\theta$ represent the field of view of the eye.
Rays are traced from the eye through the field of view to find the
object that blocks that ray of light. Ray tracing is then recursively
called from the blocking position to account for reflected light
sources. This recursive step can be performed for as many steps as
desired.

One challenge in ray tracing is that we need a way to represent object
geometries. Triangulations or tesselations can be used for this purpose.
