[TODO: This is sciml talk notes from talk by Yu
Wang]\{style="color: red"\} The shape analysis community in graps has a
long history of building group transformation invariant algorithms.

## Shape Analysis

[TODO: Look at shape analysis review article with Yu Wang and Justin
Solomon]\{style="color: red"\}

Two tasks

-   Distance

-   Segmentation

-   Shape Description

-   Correspondance: Given two shapes, find 1-1 mapping.

Shape analysis is the generalization of image analysis to 3D. It's
something of a 2.5D problem since the boundary of the image is what ends
up really matters.

## Operator Approach to Shape Analysis

For example, consider a mesh representation of a shape. There are many
possible meshes you can use.

We define a shape as the discretization of a continuous operator on a
surface ([TODO: I'm not entirely sure how this
works.]\{style="color: red"\}) You use the Laplacian operator

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mathbb\{R\}^2: \Delta^2: \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial x^2\} + \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial y^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

The Laplace-Beltrami operator is a linear operator defined on a
manifold. You can use the finite element method to discretize the
operator. This will result in the derivation of a \"cotangent\"
Laplacian.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \Delta_M: \frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{|det g|\} \partial_i(\sqrt\{|det g|\})g^\{ij\}...
\end\{aligned\}$$

Some you have some discretized geometry operator
$S: \mathbb\{R\}^\{n \times n\}$. This type of analysis is called spectral
analysis.

[TODO: How does this relate to the rest of the
book?]\{style="color: red"\}

The goal here is to create an innvariance to the representation of the
mesh.

ShapeDNA advocates using Laplacian eigenvalues as vector representation
for shape retrieval.

Operator spectrum provides a shape2vector approach. Shape -\>
eigenvalues -\> semantics. Map from eigenvalues to semantics can be
learned.

Why does a operator representation have robustness to noise? The lower
eigenvalues are more stable to perturbation

Heat kernel signatures. Here $k_t$ is also known as a Green's funciton.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    h_t(x) &= k_t(x, x) \\
    k_t(x, y) &= \sum_\{i=0\}^\infty e^\{-\lambda_i t\} \phi_i(x) \phi_j(y) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

$h_t(x)$ is a function for each point on the surface.

Wave kernel signature contains a filter signature other than
$f(\lambda) = e^\{-\lambda t\}$. Optimal spectral decompositions consider
a differetn filter.

## Intrinsic and Extrinsic Operators

Extrinsic geometry care about the embedding of a shape in
$\mathbb\{R\}^3$. Intrinsic shapes are invariant to isometry. An isometry
is length preserving. The Laplacian operator is invariant to isometries.

An intrinsic geometry is any origami equivalent to a flat piece of
paper.

People usually work with intrinsic operators but extrinsic operators are
starting to become popular.

## Operators for Geometric Analysis

### Dirichlet to Neumann Operators $\mathcal\{S\}$

Consider a volume $\Omega$ bounded $\Gamma = \partial \Omega$. The
neumann data is $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g_n &= \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial n\} u(\Gamma)
\end\{aligned\}$$ DtN operator is $$\begin\{aligned\}
    g \mapsto g_n
\end\{aligned\}$$ Also called the Stekhov-Poincare operator. $\mathcal\{S\}$
can be written as a composition of 4 operators, boundary operators. This
can be generalized to open surface.

The operator $\mathcal\{V\}$ the single layer potential is defined as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [V\phi](x) &= \int_\Gamma G(x, y) \phi(y) dy
\end\{aligned\}$$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    v(x, y) &= \frac\{1\}\{|x-y|\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is an inverse distance operator. The operator
$\mathcal\{S\}$ encodes the extrinsic geometry of the system.

Level sets of Steklov eigenfunctions conform to mean curvatures.

### Dirac Operators

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    D = \sqrt\{\Delta\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ [TODO: Look at \"Surface Networks\" paper. Also look up
extrinsic dirac operators paper]\{style="color: red"\}

## Learnable Operators

others]\{style="color: red"\}
