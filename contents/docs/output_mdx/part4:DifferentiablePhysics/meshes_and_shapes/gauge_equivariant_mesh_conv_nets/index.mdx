Meshes are of fundamental importance in applied engineering or graphics
task. They provide for a breakdown of a three dimensional object into a
discrete shape defined by the mesh graph.

Designing a mesh convolution operation is tricky since a naive
implementation flattens the mesh and loses the local geometric structure
of the mesh. The core idea is that using an \"anisotropic\" filter
allows for preserving the local geometric structure on the mesh.

## Algorithmic Definition

Let $M$ represent a mesh. Let $\theta_\{p,q\}$ be an orientation. We
consider an orientation dependent kernel $K(\theta)$. We also consider a
transport operator $$\begin\{aligned\}
\rho(g_\{q \to p\}) \in \mathbb\{R\}^\{C \times C\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ that maps from the feature space at node $q$ to the
feature space at node $p$. The gauge equivariant mesh convolution is
then defined by the following equation $$\begin\{aligned\}
(K \star f)_p &= K_\{\textrm\{self\}\} f_p + \sum_\{q \in \mathcal\{N\}(p)\} K_\{\textrm\{neigh\}\}(\theta) \rho(g_\{q \to p\}) f_q
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is a linear convolution. In order to build a full
architecture, we also need to construct gauge equivariant
nonlinearities.
