In this chapter we introduce the structure of the Klein-Gordon field. We
start by deriving the classical Klein-Gordon equation from Schrodinger's
equation along the lines of special relativity, and then discuss
commutation relationships to quantize the field.

## Klein Gordon Equation

We can attempt to modify the energy term in the Schrodinger equation to
more closely match the updated form for energy from special relativity.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac\{m^2c^2\}\{\hbar^2\} \psi = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The d'Alembert operator is denoted by $\Box$ and is defined by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\Box = -\eta^\{\mu \nu\} \partial_\{\mu\} \partial_\{\nu\} = \frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} - \nabla^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ If we define $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \mu &= \frac\{mc\}\{\hbar\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ we can write the Klein-Gordon equation in simplified
form as $$\begin\{aligned\}
    (\Box + \mu^2) \psi &= 0
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Derivation from Schrodinger's Equation

Recall that the Schrodinger equation for a free particle is given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \frac\{\hat\{p\}^2\}\{2m\} \psi = \hat\{E\} \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{p\} = -i \hbar \nabla
\end\{aligned\}$$ and $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \hat\{E\} = i \hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Recall the definition of energy in special relativity $$\begin\{aligned\}
    E = \sqrt\{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let's quantize this equation by inserting in the
corresponding operators $$\begin\{aligned\}
    i\hbar\frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\} \psi = \sqrt\{(-i\hbar \nabla)^2c^2 + m^2c^4\} \psi 
\end\{aligned\}$$ Taking the square root of an operator is quite
challenging, so let's go back and deal with the squared equation.
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4
\end\{aligned\}$$ Quantizing this equation and simplifying, we get
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    (-i\hbar \frac\{\partial\}\{\partial t\})^2 \psi &= ((-i\hbar \nabla)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4) \psi \\
    -\hbar^2 \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi &= - \hbar^2 \nabla^2 c^2\psi + m^2c^4 \psi \\
    -\frac\{1\}\{c^2\} \frac\{\partial^2\}\{\partial t^2\} \psi &= \frac\{m^2c^2\}\{\hbar^2\} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Solving the Free Klein-Gordon Equation

From the previous section, we have the energy equation from relativity
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 &= p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
\end\{aligned\}$$ To simplify calculations in field theory, it is common
to assume "natural" units where $$\begin\{aligned\}
    c &= \hbar = 1
\end\{aligned\}$$ Under these units we have $$\begin\{aligned\}
    E^2 &= p^2 + m^2
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then propose an ansatz for the family of
solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation as follows $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= e^\{i(E t - \vec\{p\}\cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ We leave as an exercise to the reader that this proposed
$\psi$ is a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation. To construct the
general solution to the equation, we integrate over all possible values
of $E$ and $\vec\{p\}$ subject to the relativistic constraint that
$E^2 = p^2 + m^2$ $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int dE \int d\vec\{p\} \psi(t, \vec\{p\}) \delta(E^2 - \vec\{p\}^2 - m^2) e^\{i(E t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ To simplify this expression, we make use of the
relationship $$\begin\{aligned\}
E(\vec\{p\}) &= \pm \sqrt\{\vec\{p\}^2 - m^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Let us define $$\begin\{aligned\}
\omega &= \sqrt\{\vec\{p\}^2 - m^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Then we can replace the integral over $dE$ with just the
sum of these two possible values of $E$ for a given $\vec\{p\}$
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int d\vec\{p\} \frac\{\psi(t, \vec\{p\})\}\{2 \omega(\vec\{p\})\} (e^\{i(\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\} + e^\{i(-\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

## Commutation Relations and Quantization

For a discrete quantum system of $n$ particles, we know that particles
satisfy the following commutation relationship $$\begin\{aligned\}
    [q_i, p_j] &= i \delta_\{ij\} \\
    [q_i, q_j] &= [p_i, p_j] = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ For quantum field theories we instead have continuous
particle densities $\phi(x)$ and momentum densities $\pi(x)$. Recall
that $\phi(x),\pi(x)$ are both operators. We then transform the above
discrete relationships into the following continuous relationships
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    [\phi(x), \pi(y)] &= i \delta^\{(3)\}(x-y) \\
    [\phi(x), \phi(y)] &= [\pi(x), \pi(y)] = 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ Recall then that the classical Klein-Gordon field is
$$\begin\{aligned\}
    \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int \frac\{d^3p\}\{(2\pi)^3\} e^\{i p \cdot x\} \phi(p, t)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Here $\phi(p, t)$ is the Fourier transform into momentum space of the
classical field.

## Defining the Free Field

Crudely, to obtain the free field solution, we replace the spatial wave
function by the spatial density and the momentum wave function by the
momentum density. $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \psi(t, \vec\{x\}) &\mapsto \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) \\
    \psi(t, \vec\{p\}) &\mapsto \pi(t, \vec\{p\})
\end\{aligned\}$$ We can then plug into the earlier solution we derived to
obtain $$\begin\{aligned\}
    \phi(t, \vec\{x\}) &= \int d\vec\{p\} \frac\{\pi(t, \vec\{p\})\}\{2 \omega(\vec\{p\})\} (e^\{i(\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\} + e^\{i(-\omega(\vec\{p\}) t - \vec\{p\} \cdot \vec\{x\})\}
\end\{aligned\}$$
