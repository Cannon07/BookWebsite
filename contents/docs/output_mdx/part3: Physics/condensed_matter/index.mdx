Spectroscopy is one of the fundamental techniques used for materials
characterization, and studies the interaction between matter and
electromagnetic radiation. The physics of spectroscopy is governed by
the interaction between light and matter.

## The Interaction of Light and Matter

Matter is composed of atoms or molecules, and often has infinitely many
energy eigenstates. Spectral lines are associated with allowed
transitions between two of these energy eigenstates. From a physical
perspective, it is often sufficient to take only two of the possible
energy eigenstates into account.

An example worth discussing is laser transition, where the pumping of
the laser can be described by a relaxation process into the upper laser
level and out of the lower laser level. The resulting model is simple,
often referred to as a two-level atom, and is mathematically analogous
to a spin $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$ particle in an external magnetic field. This is
due to the fact that the spin can only be parallel or anti-parallel to
the field -- it has two energy levels and energy eigenstates. The
interaction of the two-level atom with the electric field of an
electromagnetic wave is described by the Bloch equations.

## Diffraction

Consider a collection of $N$ particles in a material. To probe distances
at the angstrom range, we would irradiate the sample with X-rays or
neutrons; our discussion will assume X-ray scattering. A beam with
wavelength $\lambda$ illuminates the sample. The incident beam is
coherent, *i.e.* all photons are in-phase. Due to a difference between
the refractive index of the particles and their surroundings, each
particle acts as a scattering center

Compare the pathlengths for scattering from 2 different particles. The
position of the $i$th and $j$th particles are located at $\vec\{r\}_i$ and
$\vec\{r\}_j$, respectively. The difference in the pathlength of the 2
photons in Fig. [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}
is given by the difference between lengths $B$ and $A$, since these are
the only segments that differ between the two photons.

Define the incident wavevector: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\}_0 &= \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction of the solution, and $\vec\{u\}_0$ is
a unit vector that defines the direction of the incident light.
Similarly, define the scattered wavevector:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\}_s = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\vec\{u\}_s
\end\{aligned\}$$

The fixed detector orientation relative to the source is defined by the
angle $\theta$.

Using these definitions, the two lengths $B$ and $A$ are given:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
B &= (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_s \\
A &= (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot \vec\{u\}_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The pathlength difference is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
B - A = (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)\cdot (\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

This results in a phase difference given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\phi_\{ij\} &= \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(B - A) = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0) \cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the scattering vector $\vec\{q\}$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{q\} = \frac\{2\pi n\}\{\lambda\}(\vec\{u\}_s - \vec\{u\}_0)
\end\{aligned\}$$

whose magnitude is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
q = |\vec\{q\}| = \frac\{4\pi n\}\{\lambda\}\sin\left(\frac\{\theta\}\{2\}\right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

We have $$\begin\{aligned\}
\phi_\{ij\} = \vec\{q\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The electric field of light scattered by the $i$th particle relative to
the phase of light scattered by the $k$th particle is: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq16\}
E_i = E_0C \cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi _\{ik\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $n$ is the frequency, $E_0$ is the amplitude of the incident
electric field, and $C$ incorporates a number of experiment-specific
parameters (*e.g.* distance to detector, wavelength, polarizability).
The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the total
electric field squared. The average scattering intensity $I_s$ is given
by the intensity averaged over a complete oscillation period and is
given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq17\}
I_s &= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt\left[ \sum_\{i=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}) \right]^2 \notag\\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\})\cos(2\pi\nu t - \phi_\{jk\}) \notag\\
&= 2I_0C^2\nu\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N[\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\}) + \cos(\phi_\{ik\}- \phi_\{jk\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

which makes use of the property:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\cos A \cos B = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos(A + B) + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\cos (A- B)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Noting that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq19\}
\int_0^\{1/\nu\}dt\cos(4\pi\nu t - \phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\}) =0
\end\{aligned\}$$

and, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq20\}
\phi_\{ik\} - \phi_\{jk\} = \phi_\{ij\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

we have, $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
I_s &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos\phi_\{ij\} \notag\\
 &= I_0C^2\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Measuring $I_s$ at zero scattering angle ($\theta = 0$) gives the
unknown parameters $I_0$ and $A$. Therefore,

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N\cos[\vec\{q\}\cdot(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j)]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the structure factor $S(\vec\{k\})$ to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
S(\vec\{k\}) = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\sum_\{i=1\}^N\sum_\{j=1\}^N \bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}_j) \right] \bigg\rangle
\end\{aligned\}$$

we can write:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = Re[S(\vec\{q\})]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Rotational invariance gives $S(\vec\{k\}) = S(-\vec\{k\})$, thus:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{I_s(\vec\{q\})\}\{I_s(\vec\{q\}=\vec\{0\})\} = S(\vec\{q\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

Expand the structure factor into $i = j$ and $i \neq j$. This gives:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
S(\vec\{k\}) & = \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}N(N-1)\bigg\langle \exp\left[ i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2) \right] \bigg\rangle \notag\\
& = \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\}\frac\{N(N-1)\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\}e^\{-\beta U\}\}\{\int\prod_\{i=1\}^Nd\vec\{r\}_ie^\{-\beta U\}\}\notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_2\rho^\{(2,N)\}(\vec\{r\}_1,\vec\{r\}_2)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot (\vec\{r\}_1 - \vec\{r\}_2)\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N^2\} \int d\vec\{r\}_1d\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\rho^2g(r_\{12\})e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}_\{12\}\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{1\}\{N\} + \frac\{1\}\{N\}\rho \int d\vec\{r\}g(r)e^\{i\vec\{k\}\cdot\vec\{r\}\} = N^\{-1\} + N^\{-1\}\rho\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\}) \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{g\}(\vec\{k\})$ is the Fourier transform of $g(\vec\{k\})$.
This demonstrates that the results of a scattering experiment give a
direct measure of the pair distribution of the particles in a material.


# Fermions and Bosons

Particles come in two fundamental types, fermions and bosons. These two
particles are differentiated by whether they obey the Pauli exclusion
principle, which states that two particles with half-integer spins
cannot occupy the same quantum state.

## Statistics of Particles

As we briefly mentioned, fermions and bosons obey different statistical
properties.

### Bose-Einstein Statistics

Bosons are indistinguishable from one-another and can occupy the same
energy state. The probability density collection for a set of bosons is
given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
f(E_i) = \frac\{g_i\}\{e^\{(E_i - \mu)/k_BT\} - 1\},
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $g_i$ is the degeneracy (the number of quantum
states that share the same energy level), $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant,
$E_i$ is the energy of the $i$-th possible state, $T$ is the absolute
temperature, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential. This equation can be
derived from the form of the grand canonical ensemble that we
encountered earlier in the book.

### Fermi-Dirac Statistics

The Fermi-Dirac statistics describe the distributions ion over energies
for an ensemble of particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle and
which is at thermal equilibrium. As a technical condition, these
particles have half integer spin and are called fermions. The energy
distribution is given by the following probability density function.

$$\begin\{aligned\}
    f(E_i) = \frac\{1\}\{1 + e^\{(E_i - \mu)/k_BT\}\},
\end\{aligned\}$$

This formula can also be derived from the grand canonical ensemble.
Electrons are examples of fermions.

Analogous to the relationship of photons to electromagnetic or light
energy, phonons are a definite discrete unit of quantum vibrational
mechanical energy. Phonons and electrons transport are the main
mechanism of energy diffusion in crystals. Thus for non-conducting
crystals, heat transport is mostly carried by phonons transport, and so
a proper description of the thermodynamic of phonons is necessary to
understand the origins of the thermal properties of solids.

In this chapter, we use statistical mechanics to derive the
thermodynamic of phonon gases, which are the normal modes of low
temperature solids. At low temperatures, atoms in a crystal remain close
to their equilibrium position, so a simple model can be developed to
describe the energy states of this particles. At the end of this chapter
we will derive the heat capacity of crystals due to the contribution of
phonons considering two different approaches: the *Einstein Model* which
consider all phonons vibrating at the same frequency (valid for optical
phonons); and the *Debye Model* which consider a linear dispersion of
frequencies (valid for acoustic phonons at low temperatures).

## Crystalline Solid

:::

The atoms in a crystal are arranged in a regular array of points in
space with a variety of possible crystalline lattices
(Fig. [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}). At zero
temperature, the atomic coordinates are uniquely locked into spatial
positions that minimize the energy. At finite temperature, the atoms
fluctuate about the energy-minimum positions, leading to lattice
vibrations that govern the thermodynamic behavior
(Fig. [1.1](#fig5)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig5"\}).

energy-minimum positions at $T = 0$ and the lattice vibrations that

temperature](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/phonon_gas/atoms _in_crystel5.png)\{#fig5
width="\\linewidth"\}

## Thermodynamic contribution of lattice vibrations

Consider N atoms with positions $$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\vec\{r\}\} = \vec\{r\}_1, \vec\{r\}_2,\dotsc,\vec\{r\}_N
\end\{aligned\}$$ in a crystalline lattice. Define the potential energy
$V\left(\{\vec\{r\}\}\right)$ that describes the energy for a given system
configuration $\{\vec\{r\}\}$. As before, we will simplify notation to
$V(\vec\{r\})$ when the meaning is clear from context. A minimum-energy
configuration $$\begin\{aligned\}
\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\} &= \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_1, \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_2,\dotsc,\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_N
\end\{aligned\}$$ satisfies the condition $$\begin\{aligned\}
\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V\left(\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\right) = \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V|_0 = \vec\{0\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ for $i = 1,2,...,N$. The atomic positions
$\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}$ define the regular crystalline lattice.

Expand the potential energy about $\{\vec\{r\}\} = \{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}$,
such that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
V\left(\vec\{r\}\right) \approx \  &V\left(\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\right) + \sum_\{i=1\}^N \left(\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V|_0\right)\cdot \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right) + \notag\\ &\frac\{1\}\{2\} \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N \left(\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_j\} V|_0\right) \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right) \left(\vec\{r\}_j - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_j \right) + \dotsc \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

The linear term is zero (by definition), thus the energy is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq17\}
V \approx V_0 + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N \sum_\{\alpha,\gamma = x,y,z\} s_\{i\alpha\}s_\{j\gamma\}K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $$\begin\{aligned\}
s_\{i\alpha\} &= \hat\{e\}_\alpha \cdot \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right) \\ 
K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\} &= \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_j\} V|_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

The matrix $K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\}$ can be diagonalized into normal modes
(eigenvectors) with effective elastic constants (eigenvalues). Since
there are $3N-6\approx 3N$ degrees of freedom, there are $3N$ normal
modes.

The potential energy is written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq18\}
V = V_0 + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \tilde\{K\}_l \xi_l^2
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\xi_l$ is the magnitude of the $l$th normal mode.

The total energy of the system is then written as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq19\}
E = \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\frac\{\tilde\{p\}_l^2\}\{2\tilde\{m\}_l\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\tilde\{K\}_l \xi_l^2 + V_0
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\tilde\{p\}_l$ and $\tilde\{m\}_l$ are the effective momentum and
mass of the $l$th normal mode, respectively.

The total energy $E$ is decomposed into normal modes with an
individual-mode energy in the form of a harmonic oscillator. These
normal modes are called *phonons*. Phonons act as quasi-particles which
means they are distinguishable and independent, *i.e.* they don't
interact between each other.

The Hamiltonian (sum of kinetic and potential energy) of the $l$th
phonon is given by $$\begin\{aligned\}
H_l &= \frac\{\tilde\{p\}_l^2\}\{2\tilde\{m\}_l\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}K_l\xi^2_l
\end\{aligned\}$$ This harmonic oscillator energy results in the quantized
energy: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq20\}
E_l = \left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $j_l = 0,1,2...$, and the phonon frequency is
$\omega_l = \sqrt\{\frac\{\tilde\{K\}_l\}\{\tilde\{m\}_l\}\}$.

The canonical partition function $Q$ is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
Q(T,V,N) &= \sum_\{j_1 = 0\}^\infty \sum_\{j_2 = 0\}^\infty ... \sum_\{j_\{3N\} = 0\}^\infty e^\{\left[ -\beta V_0 - \beta \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l \right]\} \notag\\
&= e^\{ -\beta V_0 \} \prod_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \sum_\{j_l = 0\}^\infty e^\{-\beta\left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l\} \notag\\
&=e^\{ -\beta V_0 \} \prod_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \frac\{e^\{-\beta\frac\{1\}\{2\}\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we use the mathematical property $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_\{n=0\}^\infty z^n &= \frac\{1\}\{1 - z\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

This gives the Helmholtz free energy: $$\begin\{aligned\}
F = -k_BT\log Q = V_0 + k_BT \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\left[\log\left(1-e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\right) + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\beta\hslash\omega_l \right] \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

The average energy is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq.E_Phonons\}
\langle E \rangle = -\frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial \beta\} = V_0 + \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left( \frac\{\hslash\omega_le^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\hslash\omega_l \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

The next step is to analyze two competing models for the phonon
frequencies $\omega_l$.

## Einstein model

In the Einstein model, we assume there is a single characteristic
frequency of the crystal, defined as the Einstein frequency $\omega_E$.
This model is a good approximation for optical phonons.

The average energy for this model is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle = V_0 + \frac\{3N\hslash\omega_E\}\{2\} + \frac\{3N\hslash\omega_Ee^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1-e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_E\}\} \notag   
\end\{aligned\}$$

For this model, the heat capacity is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V = \left( \frac\{\partial \langle E \rangle\}\{\partial T\} \right)_\{V,N\} =  \frac\{3Nk_B \left( \frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\} \right) ^2 e^\{-\frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\}\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{\frac\{-\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\}\}\right)^2\} = \frac\{3Nk_B \left( \frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\} \right) ^2 e^\{-\frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\}\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{\frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\}\}\right)^2\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we define $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_E = \frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_B\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

In the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$ the heat capacity $$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V \rightarrow 3Nk_B
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is known as the Dulong-Petit Law. As we learned
before, the equipartition theorem states that the energy receives $k_BT$
per thermally active degree of freedom for a harmonic oscillator
(quantized energy is linear in the quantum index). In the limit
$T \rightarrow 0$ the heat capacity $$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V \rightarrow 0
\end\{aligned\}$$ The heat capacity approaches zero exponentially in the
small-$T$ limit (Fig. [\[fig6\]](#fig6)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig6"\}).

:::

## Debye model

The Debye model treats the solid as an elastic material. This
approximation is usually accurate to describe acoustic phonons at low
temperatures.

Vibrational modes in an elastic solid correspond to sound waves, thus
the frequencies satisfy $$\begin\{aligned\}
\omega=ck
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $c$ is the speed of sound in the solid and
$$\begin\{aligned\}
k = m\pi/L
\end\{aligned\}$$ where $m=1,2,\dotsc$.

Thus, for considering a long particle chain, we convert the sum over
normal modes into a integral over the frequencies $\omega$ using:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left( \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l &=\sum_\{m_1\}\sum_\{m_2\}\sum_\{m_3\} \left( \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l \notag\\
&= \iiint \left[\left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l\right] dm_1dm_2dm_3 \notag\\
&=\iiint_0^\{k_c\} \left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left[\left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l\right] dk_1dk_2dk_3 \notag\\
&= \int_0^\{k_c\} 4\pi\left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l k^2 dk \notag\\
&= \int_0^\{\omega_D\}D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega\notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $$\begin\{aligned\}
D(\omega) = \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2c^3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is the density of states of acoustic phonons , and
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle n \rangle = \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ is the Bose-Einstein Distribution. In this equation
$k_c$ is a cutoff wavemode (to be determined), and $\omega_D = Ck_c$ is
called the Debye frequency.

A complete conversion will include one longitudinal mode with $c_l$ and
two transverse modes with $c_t$ . This gives: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq22\}
\sum_l \left( \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l &= \int_0^\{\omega_D\} \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega \notag\\
&=\int_0^\{\omega_D\} D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we defined a new form for the density of states given by
$$\begin\{aligned\}
D(\omega) = \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right)
\end\{aligned\}$$

To find $\omega_D$ we must enforce that $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_l 1 &= 3N,
\end\{aligned\}$$ Thus we have: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_l 1 &= \int_0^\{\omega_D\}D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) d\omega \notag\\
&= \left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right) \frac\{\omega_D^3\}\{3\} = 3N \notag\\&\Rightarrow \omega_D = \frac\{\pi\}\{L\}\left[\frac\{9N\}\{\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right)\}\right]^\{1/3\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

For convenience, use $\omega_D$ as a parameter, thus we can define the
density of states as: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq23\}
D(\omega) = \frac\{9N\omega^2\}\{\omega_D\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

::: marginfigure
![image](figures/Physics/statistical_mechanics/phonon_gas/Fig7.png)\{width="\\linewidth"\}
:::

Define the Debye temperature $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_D = \frac\{\hslash\omega_D\}\{k_B\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ which defines the temperature scale for vibrational
fluctuations. To test this model, we find the heat capacity:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V &= -k_B\beta^2\left(\frac\{\partial\langle E\rangle\}\{\partial\beta\}\right) \\
&= 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\theta_D/T\}\frac\{x^4e^\{-x\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{-x\}\right)^2\} dx 
\end\{aligned\}$$

In the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$ the heat capacity approaches:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V \rightarrow 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\theta_D/T\}dxx^2 = 3Nk_B \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

which is expected (Dulong-Petit Law), since at high temperatures all
phonon modes become activated.

In the limit $T \rightarrow 0$ the heat capacity scales as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V \rightarrow 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\infty\}\frac\{x^4e^\{-x\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{-x\}\right)^2\} dx \sim Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

To obtain a qualitative picture of the Debye $T^3$ law, we suppose that
all phonon modes of wavevector less than $K_T$ have the classical
thermal energy $k_BT$ and that modes between $K_T$ and the Debye cutoff
$K_D$ are not excited at all. Of the $3N$ possible modes, the fraction
excited is $$\begin\{aligned\}
(K_T/K_D)^3 &=(T/\theta)^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ because this is the ratio of the volume of the inner
sphere to the outer sphere. The energy is $$\begin\{aligned\}
U \approx k_BT \cdot 3N(T/\theta)^3
\end\{aligned\}$$ and the heat capacity is $$\begin\{aligned\}
C_v &=\frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial T\} = 12Nk_B(T/\theta)^3
\end\{aligned\}$$

The heat capacity predicted by the Einstein and the Debye models are
very similar. However, the low temperature of the heat capacity of
non-conducting solids matches the Debye model, *i.e.* $C_V \sim NT^3$
(Fig. [\[fig7\]](#fig7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig7"\}). This is
because at low temperatures only acoustic phonons are activated, which
is better represented in the Debye model.

Electrons are fundamental elementary particles that are fermions. With
this information, together with a correct quantum-mechanical model for
the energy levels of electrons, we can derive the thermodynamic
properties of electrons present inside metals. These electrons can
modeled as an ideal gas of fermions with high densities, assuring the
occupation of many single particle energy levels due to the Pauli
exclusion principle, and making the interaction between particles
negligible.

In this chapter we will develop the thermodynamic description of
electrons in metals.

## Fermi-Dirac statistics for conducting electrons in a metal

Electrons in a metal can be modeled as a gas of non-interacting fermions
considering the following assumptions:

-   Electrons in a metal have high densities (many atoms per unit volume
    each contribute to the conducting electrons).

-   Since no two electrons (fermions) can exist in the same state, a
    high density system fills many of the single particle energy levels

-   The lowest unoccupied state will have a kinetic energy much larger
    than $k_BT$, thus thermal excitations result in energetics with
    large kinetic energy and comparatively negligible potential energy
    of interaction.

-   The large kinetic energy associated with these electrons results in
    large conductivity of electrons in metals

Using the results for the thermodynamic behavior of non-interacting
fermions, we want to find the behavior of an ideal gas of electrons in a
metal. Based on the previous assumptions, electrons in a metal act as
non-interacting particles with quantized energies given by:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
E_\{\vec\{n\}\} = \frac\{h^2\}\{8mL^2\}\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\right) \hspace\{1.0cm\} \text\{(translational modes)\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

which are the energy levels for a particle in a box for a particles with
mass $m$.

The average number of electrons in the $\vec\{n\}$ state is:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq7\}
\langle n_\{\vec\{n\}\} \rangle = \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta (E_\{\vec\{n\}\} - \mu)\} + 1\} = f(E_\{\vec\{n\}\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have defined the Fermi function $$\begin\{aligned\}
f(\varepsilon) = \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta(\varepsilon - \mu)\} + 1\}
\end\{aligned\}$$.

The total number of electrons is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle N \rangle = 2 \sum_\{n_x = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_y = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_z = 1\}^\infty \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta (E_\{\vec\{n\}\} - \mu)\} + 1\} =  2 \sum_\{n_x = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_y = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_z = 1\}^\infty f(E_\{\vec\{n\}\})
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we include a factor of 2 since the electrons can exist in spin-up
and a spin-down states.

For sufficiently large $V$, the spectrum of translational wavemodes is
effectively a continuum. Therefore, we can convert this summation to an
integral over $\vec\{n\}$, resulting in: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle N \rangle &= 2 \int_0^\infty dn_x \int_0^\infty dn_y \int_0^\infty dn_z f(E_\{\vec\{n\}\})\\
&= 2 \int_0^\infty dk_x \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} \int_0^\infty dk_y \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} \int_0^\infty dk_z \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} f[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] \notag\\
&= 2 \frac\{L^3\}\{\pi^3\} \frac\{1\}\{2^3\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_x \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_y \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_z f[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] \\ 
&= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} F[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used a coordinate change from $\vec\{n\}$ to
$\vec\{k\} = \frac\{\pi\}\{L\}\vec\{n\}$, and the energy is now written as
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Define the chemical potential at $T =0$ to be $$\begin\{aligned\}
 \mu(T=0)=\varepsilon_F
\end\{aligned\}$$ This is referred to as the Fermi energy. Consider the
form of the Fermi function at $T=0$, $$\begin\{aligned\}
f(\varepsilon) = \begin\{cases\}
1 & \textrm\{ for \}\varepsilon \le \varepsilon_F \\ 
0 & \textrm\{ for \}\varepsilon > \varepsilon_F
\end\{cases\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Define the Fermi momentum $p_F$ according to
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\varepsilon_F &= \frac\{p^2_F\}\{2m\} = \frac\{\hslash^2 k_F^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ Thus, at $T = 0$, $\langle N \rangle$ is found to be:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
 \label\{AveN_electrons\}
\langle N \rangle = \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \frac\{4\}\{3\}\pi k_F^3 = \frac\{8\}\{3\}\pi\frac\{V(2m)^\{3/2\}\}\{h^3\}\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ where the fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$ is given
explicitly by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
 \label\{FermiEnergy\}
\varepsilon_F = \left(\frac\{3\rho\}\{8\pi\}\right)^\{2/3\} \frac\{h^2\}\{2m\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

A typical metal (*Cu*) has a mass density of $9g/cm^3$. Assuming each
atom donates a single electron to the conducting electron gas, this
density has a Fermi temperature: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\theta_F = \frac\{\varepsilon_F\}\{k_B\} \approx 80,000K
\end\{aligned\}$$

this verifies that the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$ is sufficiently
large to make the ideal gas approximation valid at room temperature. At
room temperature, only states with energy very near
$\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_F$ will be affected by thermal energy
$k_BT$. The spread in the distribution is approximately $2k_BT$
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}).

The pressure is found using the relationship for Fermi particles
$$\label\{Eq9\}
pV = 2k_BT\sum_\alpha \log \left(1 + e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\} \right)$$

Following a similar derivation as before, we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
pV &= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} \log \{ 1 + e^\{-\beta [ \varepsilon (\vec\{k\}) - \mu]\} \} \\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{1/2\} \log \left[ 1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used $\varepsilon = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}$.

In the limit $T \rightarrow 0$ or $\beta \rightarrow \infty$, we have
$$\begin\{aligned\}
1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \rightarrow  e^\{\beta ( \varepsilon_F - \varepsilon)\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ for $\varepsilon < \varepsilon_F$ and $$\begin\{aligned\}
 1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \rightarrow 1
\end\{aligned\}$$ for $\varepsilon > \varepsilon_F$. Therefore, the
pressure is written as:

$$\begin\{aligned\}
pV &= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{3/2\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\{\varepsilon_F\} d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{1/2\} (\varepsilon_F - \varepsilon)\\
&= \frac\{16\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{15h^3\} \varepsilon_F^\{5/2\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

This pressure at $T = 0$ is approximately $10^6 \textrm\{ atm\}$. This
large pressure plays an important role in halting the collapse of a star
(white dwarf) because this enormous pressure offsets the gravitational
forces that otherwise drive the collapse.

The average energy $\langle E \rangle$ is found using: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq12\}
\langle E \rangle = 2\sum_\alpha \varepsilon_\alpha \frac\{e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\}\}\{1 + e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Following a similar derivation as before, we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle &= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} \varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta [ \varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) - \mu]\}+1\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{3/2\} \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta [ \varepsilon - \mu]\}+1\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{3/2\} F(\varepsilon) \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used $\varepsilon = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}$.

We apply integration by parts to this equation and use
([\[AveN_electrons\]](#AveN_electrons)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="AveN_electrons"\}) to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle = - \frac\{3\langle N \rangle\}\{5\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{5/2\} \frac\{df\}\{d\varepsilon\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $$\begin\{aligned\}
\frac\{df\}\{d\varepsilon\} &= -\frac\{\beta e^\{\beta (\varepsilon - \mu)\}\}\{[e^\{\beta (\varepsilon - \mu)\} + 1]^2\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

In the limit $T\rightarrow0$, the function $-\frac\{df\}\{d\varepsilon\}$
becomes peaked near $\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_F$
(Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}), and we
can effectively expand the integrand near $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_F$
to get: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\varepsilon^\{5/2\} \approx \varepsilon_F^\{5/2\} + \frac\{5\}\{2\}\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_F) + \frac\{15\}\{8\}\varepsilon_F^\{1/2\}(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_F)^2 + ...
\end\{aligned\}$$

Since $\frac\{df(\varepsilon)\}\{d\varepsilon\}$ is even about
$\varepsilon_F$ in this limit, the odd-order terms will integrate to
zero, leaving only the even terms. Thus, the final form of the average
energy is going to be: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle = \langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \left[A +B\left(\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}\right)^2 +...\right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

A precise calculation of this low-temperature expansion gives:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\
\langle E \rangle = \frac\{3\}\{5\}\langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \left[1 +\frac\{5\pi^2\}\{12\}\left(\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}\right)^2 +...\right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

Therefore, the heat capacity for a metal in the limit of small
temperature is given by

$$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V = \frac\{3\}\{5\}\langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \frac\{5\pi^2\}\{12\}2\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F^2\} = \frac\{\pi^2\}\{2\}\langle N \rangle k_B\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

giving a linear temperature dependence in the small-$T$ limit.

The limiting behavior in the small-$T$ limit suggests that a plot of
$C_V/T$ approaches a constant as $T\rightarrow 0$. This proves to be the
behavior of the heat capacity for metals in the limit of small $T$. As
temperature increases, the fluctuations in the metal nuclei also
contribute to the heat capacity
(Fig. [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3"\}).

Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between that
of a metallic conductor and a nonmetallic insulator. Semiconductors have
a number of interesting physical properties. For one, their resistivity
drops as temperatures rise (unlike metals which have higher resistivity
at higher temperatures). Semiconductors can also have their conducting
properties altered by the addition of \"dopants\", impurities introduced
into the crystal structure of a semiconductor. A substance with two
differently doped regions can form a \"semiconductor junction\".

In this chapter, we introduce the foundations of semiconductor physics
and consider how to build differentiable programs that predict
semiconductor structure and behavior.

## Basic Semiconductor Physics

Semiconductors are marked by their unique conductivity behavior, between
that for conductors and insulators. To understand this behavior more
precisely, we will need to delve into the physics of electronic band
structure. An isolated atom has electrons that occupy atomic orbitals.
What happens to the electronic structure then when two atoms come
together to form a molecule? Pauli's exclusion principle dictates that
two electrons can't have the quantum number in a molecule. This means
that each atomic orbital in a diatomic molecule splits into two
molecular orbitals

Now consider a more complex situation, where $N$ identical atoms come
together to form crystal lattice. In this case, the atomic orbitals of
individual atoms will overlap. The Pauli exclusion principle then
dictates that we can't have two electrons in the solid that have the
same quantum numbers. This forces each atomic orbital for each atom to
split into $N$ discrete molecular orbitals. Macroscopic solids have very
large numbers of atoms, so these $N$ discrete molecular orbitals
effectively form a continuum since the energy gap between adjacent
molecular orbitals will be very small.

### Fermi Level

For a solid state body, the Fermi level is the thermodynamic work
required to add one electron to the body. This quantity is usually
referred to as $\mu$.

### Band Gap

For semiconductors, the band gap is the distance between the valence
band and the conduction band. It represents the amount of energy
required to promote an electron to participating in conduction.

material.](figures/Physics/condensed_matter/semiconductors/band gap structure (1).png)\{#fig:bandgap\}

### Bravais Lattice and Reciprocal Lattice

To study the mathematical properties of semiconductor systems, we need
to be able to formulate the repeating lattice structure of the material
in our equations. Let's start by defining a lattice. Conceptually, a
lattice is defined by its unit cell, which is given by three primitive
lattice vectors $$\begin\{aligned\}
\vec\{a_1\}, \vec\{a_2\}, \vec\{a_3\}
\end\{aligned\}$$ The Bravais lattice is the infinite set of points
described by

$$\vec\{r\} = n_1 \vec\{a_1\} + n_2 \vec\{a_2\} + n_3 \vec\{a_3\}, \quad n_1, n_2, n_3 \in \mathbb\{Z\}$$

To model physical crystals, we also need to consider the *primitive unit
cell*. This unit cell is given by

$$\textbf\{r\} = \{x_1 \vec\{a_1\} + x_2 \vec\{a_2\} + x_3 \vec\{a_3\} | 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 < 1 \}$$

We then say that a crystal is an arrangement of atoms within the
primitive unit cell. Note that not all the atoms have to be of the same
type.

## Solving Schrodinger's Equation in Lattices

Let's consider how to solve Schrodinger's equation for particles in a
lattice. Physically, we expect that the potential energy of the system
obeys the following symmetry

$$\begin\{aligned\}
V(\vec\{x\} + \vec\{a\}) = V(\vec\{x\}) 
\end\{aligned\}$$

That is, the potential energy repeats for each primitive unit cell. The
solutions of Schrodinger's equation for such a system are given by
Bloch's theorem which states that for electrons in a crystal lattice,
with a potential $V$ that obeys the symmetry

$$\begin\{aligned\}
V(\vec\{x\} + \vec\{a\}) = V(\vec\{x\}), 
\end\{aligned\}$$

There exists a basis of wave functions which have the following
properties: Each wave function $\psi_i$ is an energy eigenstate of
Schrodinger's equation. We can write $\psi_i$ as $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_i(r) = e^\{i k \cdot r\} u_i(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where $u(r)$ has the same periodicity as the crystal. That is,
$$\begin\{aligned\}
u(r + \vec\{a\}) = u(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ We say that a function with the form $$\begin\{aligned\}
\psi_\{i\}(r) = e^\{ik\cdot r\}u_\{i\}(r)
\end\{aligned\}$$ is a Bloch wave. Note that the Block theorem means that
given bloch state can be identified with a wave vector $k$.

## Doping

Doping is the introduction of impurities into semiconductor for the
purpose of changing its properties and behaviors.

P-type semiconductors have electron acceptors embedded into the
underlying semiconductor, whhile N-type semiconductors have electron
donors embedded into the underlying semiconductor.
