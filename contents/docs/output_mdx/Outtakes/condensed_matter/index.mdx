# Condensed Matter Physics

Condensed matter is the study of solid state systems and their
properties. This will include properties such as the behavior of
electrons within the material, the behavior of \"phonons\" (which we
will introduce shortly). This also includes the interaction of materials
with light and photons, and exotic states of matter such as
Bose-Einstein condensates.

All particles can be broadly classified into fermions and bosons. These
two types of particles obey different statistical laws. More precisely,
fermions obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, and Bosons obey Bose-Einstein
statistics. We will discuss the mathematical meaning of these
distributions in this chapter.

## Electrons

Electrons are fundamental elementary particles that are fermions, *i.e.*
occupation number cannot be larger than 1. With this information,
together with a correct quantum-mechanical model for the energy levels
of electrons, we can derive the thermodynamic properties of electrons
present inside metals. These electrons can modeled as an ideal gas of
fermions with high densities, assuring the occupation of many single
particle energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and making
the interaction between particles negligible.

In this chapter we will develop the thermodynamic description of
electrons in metals.

### Fermi-Dirac statistics for conducting electrons in a metal

Electrons in a metal can be modeled as a gas of non-interacting fermions
considering the following assumptions:

-   Electrons in a metal are at high densities (many atoms per volume
    with each contributing to the conducting electrons).

-   Since no two electrons (fermions) can exist in the same state, a
    high density system fills many of the single particle energy levels

-   The lowest unoccupied state will have a kinetic energy much larger
    than $k_BT$, thus thermal excitations result in energetics with
    large kinetic energy and comparatively negligible potential energy
    of interaction.

-   The large kinetic energy associated with these electrons results in
    large conductivity of electrons in metals

Using the results for the thermodynamic behavior of non-interacting
fermions, we want to find the behavior of an ideal gas of electrons in a
metal. Based on the previous assumptions, electrons in a metal act as
non-interacting particles with quantized energies given by:
$$E_\{\vec\{n\}\} = \frac\{h^2\}\{8mL^2\}\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\right) \hspace\{1.0cm\} \text\{(translational modes)\} \notag$$

which are the energy levels for a particle in a box for a particles with
mass $m=9.10938\times 10^\{-31\} kg$.

The average number of electrons in the $\vec\{n\}$ state is: $$
\langle n_\{\vec\{n\}\} \rangle = \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta (E_\{\vec\{n\}\} - \mu)\} + 1\} = F(E_\{\vec\{n\}\})$$

where we have defined the Fermi function
$F(\varepsilon) = \left[e^\{\beta(\varepsilon - \mu)\} + 1 \right] ^\{-1\}$.

The total number of electrons is given by: $$
\langle N \rangle = 2 \sum_\{n_x = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_y = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_z = 1\}^\infty \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta (E_\{\vec\{n\}\} - \mu)\} + 1\} =  2 \sum_\{n_x = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_y = 1\}^\infty \sum_\{n_z = 1\}^\infty F(E_\{\vec\{n\}\})$$

where we include a factor of 2 since the electrons can exist in spin-up
and a spin-down states.

For sufficiently large $V$, the spectrum of translational wavemodes is
effectively a continuum. Therefore, we can convert this summation to an
integral over $\vec\{n\}$, resulting in: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle N \rangle &= 2 \int_0^\infty dn_x \int_0^\infty dn_y \int_0^\infty dn_z F(E_\{\vec\{n\}\}) \\
&= 2 \int_0^\infty dk_x \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} \int_0^\infty dk_y \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} \int_0^\infty dk_z \frac\{L\}\{\pi\} F[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] \\
&= 2 \frac\{L^3\}\{\pi^3\} \frac\{1\}\{2^3\} \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_x \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_y \int_\{-\infty\}^\infty dk_z F[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] \\
&= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} F[\varepsilon (\vec\{k\})] 
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used a coordinate change from $\vec\{n\}$ to
$\vec\{k\} = \frac\{\pi\}\{L\}\vec\{n\}$, and the energy is now written as
$\varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}$.

Define the chemical potential at $T =0$ to be $\mu(T=0)=\varepsilon_F$
(Fermi Energy). To proceed, consider the form of the Fermi function at
$T=0$, $F(\varepsilon) = 1$ for $\varepsilon \le \varepsilon_F$ and
$F(\varepsilon) = 0$ for $\varepsilon > \varepsilon_F$. Define the Fermi
momentum $p_F$ according to
$\varepsilon_F = \frac\{p^2_F\}\{2m\} = \frac\{\hslash^2 k_F^2\}\{2m\}$. Thus,
at $T = 0$, $\langle N \rangle$ is found to be: $$\label\{AveN_electrons\}
\langle N \rangle = \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \frac\{4\}\{3\}\pi k_F^3 = \frac\{8\}\{3\}\pi\frac\{V(2m)^\{3/2\}\}\{h^3\}\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}$$
where the fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$ is given explicitly by:
$$\label\{FermiEnergy\}
\varepsilon_F = \left(\frac\{3\rho\}\{8\pi\}\right)^\{2/3\} \frac\{h^2\}\{2m\}$$

A typical metal (*Cu*) has a mass density of $9g/cm^3$. Assuming each
atom donates a single electron to the conducting electron gas, this
density has a Fermi temperature:
$$\theta_F = \frac\{\varepsilon_F\}\{k_B\} \approx 80,000K$$

this verifies that the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$ is sufficiently
large to make the ideal gas approximation valid at room temperature.

At room temperature, only states with energy very near
$\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_F$ will be affected by thermal energy
$k_BT$. The spread in the distribution is approximately $2k_BT$
(Fig. [\[fig1\]](#fig1)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"\}).

TODO: Add diagram of the Fermi function

The pressure is found using the relationship for Fermi particles
$$\label\{Eq9\}
pV = 2k_BT\sum_\alpha \log \left(1 + e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\} \right)$$

Following a similar derivation as before, we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq10\}
pV &= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} \log \{ 1 + e^\{-\beta [ \varepsilon (\vec\{k\}) - \mu]\} \} \notag\\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{1/2\} \log \left[ 1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \right]
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used $\varepsilon = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}$.

In the limit $T \rightarrow 0 (\text\{or \} \beta \rightarrow \infty)$, we
have
$1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \rightarrow  e^\{\beta ( \varepsilon_F - \varepsilon)\}$
for $\varepsilon < \varepsilon_F$ and
$1 + e^\{-\beta ( \varepsilon - \mu)\} \rightarrow 1$ for
$\varepsilon > \varepsilon_F$.

Therefore, the pressure is written as: $$\label\{Eq11\}
pV = \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{3/2\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\{\varepsilon_F\} d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{1/2\} (\varepsilon_F - \varepsilon) = \frac\{16\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{15h^3\} \varepsilon_F^\{5/2\}$$

This pressure at $T = 0$ is approximately $10^6atm$. This large pressure
plays an important role in halting the collapse of a star (white dwarf)
because this enormous pressure offsets the gravitational forces that
otherwise drive the collapse.

The average energy $\langle E \rangle$ is found using: $$\label\{Eq12\}
\langle E \rangle = 2\sum_\alpha \varepsilon_\alpha \frac\{e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\}\}\{1 + e^\{-\beta \varepsilon_\alpha + \beta \mu\}\}$$

Following a similar derivation as before, we write $$\begin\{aligned\}
\langle E \rangle &= \frac\{2V\}\{(2\pi)^3\} \int d\vec\{k\} \varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta [ \varepsilon(\vec\{k\}) - \mu]\}+1\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{3/2\} \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta [ \varepsilon - \mu]\}+1\} \notag\\
&= \frac\{4\pi V (2m)^\{2/3\}\}\{h^3\} \int_0^\infty d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{3/2\} F(\varepsilon) \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we have used $\varepsilon = \frac\{\hslash^2 k^2\}\{2m\}$.

TODO: ADD PLOT OF DERIVATIVE OF FERMI FUNCTION

We apply integration by parts to this equation and use
([\[AveN_electrons\]](#AveN_electrons)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="AveN_electrons"\}) to get: $$\label\{Eq13\}
\langle E \rangle = - \frac\{3\langle N \rangle\}\{5\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} d\varepsilon \varepsilon^\{5/2\} \frac\{dF\}\{d\varepsilon\}$$

where
$\frac\{dF\}\{d\varepsilon\} = -\frac\{\beta e^\{\beta (\varepsilon - \mu)\}\}\{[e^\{\beta (\varepsilon - \mu)\} + 1]^2\}$.

In the limit $T\rightarrow0$, the function $-\frac\{dF\}\{d\varepsilon\}$
becomes peaked near $\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_F$
(Fig. [\[fig2\]](#fig2)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig2"\}), and we
can effectively expand the integrand near $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_F$
to get:
$$\varepsilon^\{5/2\} \approx \varepsilon_F^\{5/2\} + \frac\{5\}\{2\}\varepsilon_F^\{3/2\}(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_F) + \frac\{15\}\{8\}\varepsilon_F^\{1/2\}(\varepsilon - \varepsilon_F)^2 + ...$$

Since $\frac\{dF(\varepsilon)\}\{d\varepsilon\}$ is even about
$\varepsilon_F$ in this limit, the odd-order terms will integrate to
zero, leaving only the even terms. Thus, the final form of the average
energy is going to be: $$\label\{Eq14\}
\langle E \rangle = \langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \left[A +B\left(\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}\right)^2 +...\right]$$

A precise calculation of this low-temperature expansion (outside scope
of this chapter) gives: $$\label\{Eq15\}
\langle E \rangle = \frac\{3\}\{5\}\langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \left[1 +\frac\{5\pi^2\}\{12\}\left(\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}\right)^2 +...\right]$$

Therefore, the heat capacity for a metal in the limit of small
temperature is given by: $$\label\{Eq16\}
C_V = \frac\{3\}\{5\}\langle N \rangle \varepsilon_F \frac\{5\pi^2\}\{12\}2\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F^2\} = \frac\{\pi^2\}\{2\}\langle N \rangle k_B\frac\{T\}\{\theta_F\}$$

giving a linear temperature dependence in the small-$T$ limit.

The limiting behavior in the small-$T$ limit suggests that a plot of
$C_V/T$ approaches a constant as $T\rightarrow 0$. This proves to be the
behavior of the heat capacity for metals in the limit of small $T$. As
temperature increases, the fluctuations in the metal nuclei also
contribute to the heat capacity
(Fig. [\[fig3\]](#fig3)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig3"\}).

## Phonons

Analog to the relation of photons to electromagnetic or light energy,
phonons are a definite discrete unit of quantum vibrational mechanical
energy. Phonons and electrons transport are the main mechanism of energy
diffusion in crystals. Thus for non-conducting crystals, heat transport
is mostly carried by phonons transport, and so a proper description of
the thermodynamic of phonons is necessary to understand the origins of
the thermal properties of solids.

In this chapter, we use statistical mechanics to derive the
thermodynamic of phonon gases, which are the normal modes of low
temperature solids. At low temperatures, atoms in a crystal remain close
to their equilibrium position, so a simple model can be developed to
describe the energy states of this particles. At the end of this chapter
we will derive the heat capacity of crystals due to the contribution of
phonons considering two different approaches: *Einstein Model* which
consider all phonons vibrating at the same frequency (valid for optical
phonons); and the *Debye Model* which consider a linear dispersion of
frequencies (valid for acoustic phonons at low temperatures).

### Crystalline Solid

The atoms in a crystal are arranged in a regular array of points in
space with a variety of possible crystalline lattices
(Fig. [\[fig4\]](#fig4)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig4"\}). At zero
temperature, the atomic coordinates are uniquely locked into spatial
positions that minimize the energy. At finite temperature, the atoms
fluctuate about the energy-minimum positions, leading to lattice
vibrations that govern the thermodynamic behavior

### Thermodynamic contribution of lattice vibrations

Consider N atoms with positions
$\{\vec\{r\}\} = \vec\{r\}_1, \vec\{r\}_2,...,\vec\{r\}_N$ in a crystalline
lattice. Define the potential energy $V\left(\{\vec\{r\}\}\right)$ that
describes the energy for a given system configuration $\{\vec\{r\}\}$. A
minimum-energy configuration
$\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\} = \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_1, \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_2,...,\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_N$
satisfies the condition
$\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V\left(\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}\right) = \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V|_0 = \vec\{0\}$
for $i = 1,2,...,N$. The atomic positions $\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}$ define the
regular crystalline lattice.

Expand the potential energy about $\{\vec\{r\}\} = \{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}$,
such that: $$\begin\{aligned\}
V\left(\{\vec\{r\}\}\right) \approx  &V\left(\{\vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}\}\right) + \sum_\{i=1\}^N \left(\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} V|_0\right)\cdot \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right) + \notag\\ &\frac\{1\}\{2\} \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N \left(\nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_j\} V|_0\right): \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right) \left(\vec\{r\}_j - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_j \right) + ... \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

The linear term is zero (by definition), thus the energy is:
$$\label\{Eq17\}
V \approx V_0 + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \sum_\{i=1\}^N \sum_\{j=1\}^N \sum_\{\alpha,\gamma = x,y,z\} s_\{i\alpha\}s_\{j\gamma\}K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\}$$

where
$s_\{i\alpha\} = \hat\{e\}_\alpha \cdot \left(\vec\{r\}_i - \vec\{r\}^\{(0)\}_i \right)$
and $K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\} = \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_i\} \nabla_\{\vec\{r\}_j\} V|_0$.

The Matrix $K_\{i\alpha j \gamma\}$ can be diagonalized into normal modes
(eigenvectors) with effective elastic constants (eigenvalues). Since
there are $3N-6\approx 3N$ degrees of freedom, there are $3N$ normal
modes.

The potential energy is written as: $$\label\{Eq18\}
V = V_0 + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \tilde\{K\}_l \xi_l^2$$

where $\xi_l$ is the magnitude of the $l$th normal mode.

The total energy of the system is then written as: $$\label\{Eq19\}
E = \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\frac\{\tilde\{p\}_l^2\}\{2\tilde\{m\}_l\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\tilde\{K\}_l \xi_l^2 + V_0$$

where $\tilde\{p\}_l$ and $\tilde\{m\}_l$ are the effective momentum and
mass of the $l$th normal mode, respectively.

The total energy $E$ is decomposed into normal modes with an
individual-mode energy in the form of a harmonic oscillator. These
normal modes are called *phonons*.

Phonons act as quasi-particles which means they are distinguishable and
independent, *i.e.* they don't interact between each other.

The Hamiltonian (sum of kinetic and potential energy) of the $l$th
phonon is given by:
$H_l = \frac\{\tilde\{p\}_l^2\}\{2\tilde\{m\}_l\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}K_l\xi^2_l$. This
harmonic oscillator energy results in the quantized energy:
$$\label\{Eq20\}
E_l = \left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l$$

where $j_l = 0,1,2...$, and the phonon frequency is
$\omega_l = \sqrt\{\frac\{\tilde\{K\}_l\}\{\tilde\{m\}_l\}\}$.

The canonical partition function $Q$ is given by: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq21\}
Q(T,V,N) &= \sum_\{j_1 = 0\}^\infty \sum_\{j_2 = 0\}^\infty ... \sum_\{j_\{3N\} = 0\}^\infty e^\{\left[ -\beta V_0 - \beta \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l \right]\} \notag\\
&= e^\{ -\beta V_0 \} \prod_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \sum_\{j_l = 0\}^\infty e^\{-\beta\left(j_l + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\right)\hslash\omega_l\} \notag\\
&=e^\{ -\beta V_0 \} \prod_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \frac\{e^\{-\beta\frac\{1\}\{2\}\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we use the mathematical property
$\sum_\{n=0\}^\infty z^n= \frac\{1\}\{1 - z\}$.

This gives the Helmholtz free energy:
$$F = -k_BT\log Q = V_0 + k_BT \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\}\left[\log\left(1-e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\right) + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\beta\hslash\omega_l \right] \notag$$

The average energy is given by: $$\label\{Eq.E_Phonons\}
\langle E \rangle = -\frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial \beta\} = V_0 + \sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left( \frac\{\hslash\omega_le^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\}\hslash\omega_l \right)$$

The next step is to analyze two competing models for the phonon
frequencies $\omega_l$.

### Einstein model

In the Einstein model, we assume there is a single characteristic
frequency of the crystal, defined as the Einstein frequency $\omega_E$.
This model is a good approximation for optical phonons.

The average energy for this model is given by:
$$\langle E \rangle = V_0 + \frac\{3N\hslash\omega_E\}\{2\} + \frac\{3N\hslash\omega_Ee^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_l\}\}\{1-e^\{-\beta\hslash\omega_E\}\} \notag$$

For this model, the heat capacity is given by:
$$C_V = \left( \frac\{\partial \langle E \rangle\}\{\partial T\} \right)_\{V,N\} =  \frac\{3Nk_B \left( \frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\} \right) ^2 e^\{-\frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\}\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{\frac\{-\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_BT\}\}\right)^2\} = \frac\{3Nk_B \left( \frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\} \right) ^2 e^\{-\frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\}\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{\frac\{\theta_E\}\{T\}\}\right)^2\} \notag$$

where we define $\theta_E = \frac\{\hslash\omega_E\}\{k_B\}$.

In the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$ the heat capacity
$C_V \rightarrow 3Nk_B$ (Dulong-Petit Law). As we learned before, the
equipartition theorem states that the energy receives $k_BT$ per
thermally active degree of freedom for a harmonic oscillator (quantized
energy is linear in the quantum index). In the limit $T \rightarrow 0$
the heat capacity $C_V \rightarrow 0$. The heat capacity approaches zero
exponentially in the small-$T$ limit

### Debye model

The Debye model treats the solid as an elastic material. This
approximation is usually accurate to describe acoustic phonons at low
temperatures.

Vibrational modes in an elastic solid correspond to sound waves, thus
the frequencies satisfy $\omega=ck$, where $c$ is the speed of sound in
the solid and $k = m\pi/L$, where $m=1,2,...$

Thus, for considering a long particle chain, we convert the sum over
normal modes into an integral over the frequencies $\omega$ using:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_\{l=1\}^\{3N\} \left( \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l &=\sum_\{m_1\}\sum_\{m_2\}\sum_\{m_3\} \left( \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\} + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l \notag\\
&= \iiint \left[\left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l\right] dm_1dm_2dm_3 \notag\\
&=\iiint_0^\{k_c\} \left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left[\left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l\right] dk_1dk_2dk_3 \notag\\
&= \int_0^\{k_c\} 4\pi\left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right)\hslash\omega_l k^2 dk \notag\\
&= \int_0^\{\omega_D\}D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega\notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\displaystyle D(\omega) = \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2c^3\}$, is the
*density of states* of acoustic phonons , and
$\displaystyle \langle n \rangle = \frac\{1\}\{e^\{\beta\hslash\omega_l\} - 1\}$,
is the *Bose-Einstein Distribution*. In this equation $k_c$ is a cutoff
wavemode (to be determined), and $\omega_D = Ck_c$ is called the Debye
frequency.

A complete conversion will include one longitudinal mode with $c_l$ and
two transverse modes with $c_t$ . This gives: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq22\}
\sum_l\left( ... \right) &= \int_0^\{\omega_D\} \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega \notag\\
&=\int_0^\{\omega_D\} D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) \hslash\omega_l d\omega
\end\{aligned\}$$

where we defined a new form for the density of states given by
$\displaystyle D(\omega) = \frac\{4L^3\omega^2\}\{\pi^2\}\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right)$.

To find $\omega_D$ we must enforce that $\sum_l 1 = 3N$, thus we have:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
\sum_l 1 &= \int_0^\{\omega_D\}D(\omega) \left( \langle n \rangle + \frac\{1\}\{2\} \right) d\omega \notag\\
&= \left(\frac\{L\}\{\pi\}\right)^3 \left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right) \frac\{\omega_D^3\}\{3\} = 3N \notag\\&\Rightarrow \omega_D = \frac\{\pi\}\{L\}\left[\frac\{9N\}\{\left(\frac\{1\}\{c_l^3\} + \frac\{2\}\{c_t^3\} \right)\}\right]^\{1/3\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

For convenience, use $\omega_D$ as a parameter, thus we can define the
density of states as: $$\label\{Eq23\}
D(\omega) = \frac\{9N\omega^2\}\{\omega_D\}$$

Define the Debye temperature $\theta_D = \frac\{\hslash\omega_D\}\{k_B\}$,
which defines the temperature scale for vibrational fluctuations. To
test this model, we find the heat capacity:
$$C_V = -k_B\beta^2\left(\frac\{\partial\langle E\rangle\}\{\partial\beta\}\right) = 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\theta_D/T\}dx\frac\{x^4e^\{-x\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{-x\}\right)^2\} \notag$$

In the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$ the heat capacity approaches:
$$C_V \rightarrow 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\theta_D/T\}dxx^2 = 3Nk_B \notag$$

which is expected (Dulong-Petit Law), since at high temperatures all
phonon modes become activated.

In the limit $T \rightarrow 0$ the heat capacity scales as:
$$\begin\{aligned\}
C_V \rightarrow 9Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\}\int_0^\{\infty\}dx\frac\{x^4e^\{-x\}\}\{\left(1-e^\{-x\}\right)^2\} \sim Nk_B\frac\{T^3\}\{\theta_D^3\} \notag
\end\{aligned\}$$

To obtain a qualitative picture of the Debye $T^3$ law, we suppose that
all phonon modes of wavevector less than $K_T$ have the classical
thermal energy $k_BT$ and that modes between $K_T$ and the Debye cutoff
$K_D$ are not excited at all. Of the $3N$ possible modes, the fraction
excited is $(K_T/K_D)^3=(T/\theta)^3$, because this is the ratio of the
volume of the inner sphere to the outer sphere. The energy is
$U \approx k_BT \cdot 3N(T/\theta)^3$, and the heat capacity is
$C_v=\partial U/\partial T = 12Nk_B(T/\theta)^3$.

The heat capacity predicted by the Einstein and the Debye models are
very similar. However, the low temperature of the heat capacity of
non-conducting solids matches the Debye model, *i.e.* $C_V \sim NT^3$
(Fig. [\[fig7\]](#fig7)\{reference-type="ref" reference="fig7"\}). This is
because at low temperatures only acoustic phonons are activated, which
is better represented in the Debye model.

## Photons

In the last part of this chapter, we analyze the thermodynamics of
photon gas, which constitutes the description of the radiation
properties of Black Bodies. Here we consider an electromagnetic field in
thermal equilibrium with its container. Under this condition, quantum
theory predicts that the Hamiltonian of the system can be written as a
sum of terms, each having the form of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, the
energy of each photon is given by $\hslash\omega$. This provides our
starting point for the derivation of all the thermodynamic properties of
photons from the basis of statistical mechanics. In addition to the
thermodynamic properties of photon gases, some fundamental laws for
Blackbody Radiation will be obtained, such as Planck's Law, Wien's Law,
Rayleigh-Jeans law, and Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

### Black Body Radiation

We are all familiar with the idea that hot objects emit radiation, a
light bulb, for example. In the hot wire filament, an electron,
originally in an excited state drops to a lower energy state and the
energy difference is given off as a photon,
($\epsilon = h\nu = \epsilon_2 -\epsilon_1$). We are also familiar with
the absorption of radiation by surfaces. For example, clothes in the
summer absorb photons from the sun and heat up. Black clothes absorb
more radiation than lighter ones. This means, of course that lighter
colored clothes reflect a larger fraction of the light falling on them.

A black body is defined as one which absorbs all the radiation incident
upon it, *i.e.* a perfect absorber. It also emits the radiation
subsequently. If radiation is falling on a black body, its temperature
rises until it reaches equilibrium with the radiation. At equilibrium,
it re-emits as much radiation as it absorbs so there is no net gain in
energy and the temperature remains constant. In this case, the surface
is in equilibrium with the radiation and the temperature of the surface
must be the same as the temperature of the radiation.

To develop the idea of radiation temperature we construct an enclosure
having walls which are perfect absorbers (see
Fig. [\[Fig8\]](#Fig8)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Fig8"\}). Inside
the enclosure is radiation. Eventually this radiation reaches
equilibrium with the enclosure walls, equal amounts are emitted and
absorbed by the walls. Also, the amount of radiation travelling in each
direction becomes equal and is uniform. In this case the radiation may
be regarded as a gas of photons in equilibrium having a uniform
temperature. The enclosure is then called an isothermal enclosure.

An enclosure of this type containing a small hole is itself a black
body. Any radiation passing through the hole will be absorbed. The
radiation emitted from the hole is characteristic of a black body at the
temperature of the photon gas. The properties of the emitted radiation
is then independent of the materials of the wall provided they are
sufficiently absorbing that essentially all radiation entering the hole
is absorbed. This universal radiation is called Black Body Radiation.

An everyday example of a photon gas is the background radiation in the
universe. This photon gas is at a temperature of about 5 $K$. Thus the
earth's surface, at a temperature of about 300 $K$, is not in
equilibrium with this gas. The earth is a net emitter of radiation
(excluding the sun) and this is why it is dark at night and why it is
coldest on clear nights when there is no cloud cover to increase the
reflection of the earth's radiation back to the earth. A second example
is a Bessemer converter used in steel manufacture containing molten
steel. These vessels actually contain holes like the isothermal
enclosure of Fig. [\[fig8\]](#fig8)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig8"\}. The radiation emitted from the hole is used in steel
making to measure the temperature in the vessel, by means of an optical
pyrometer.

## **Statistical Thermodynamics** \{#statistical-thermodynamics .unnumbered\}

To derive Planck's radiation law directly from our statistical
mechanics, we note that number of photons in the gas is not fixed. The
photons are absorbed and re-emitted by the enclosure walls. Since the
photons are non-interacting it is by this absorption and re-emission
that equilibrium is maintained in the gas. Since, also the free energy
$F(T, V, N)$ is constant in equilibrium (at constant $T$ and $V$ ) while
N varies it follows that $\partial F/\partial N = 0$, that is
$$\mu = \frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial N\}\bigg|_\{V,N\} = 0 \notag$$

The photon gas is then a Bose gas with $\mu= 0$, so that the canonical
partition function is given directly as $$\label\{Part_photon\}
Q = \sum_\{s_1,s_2,...s_j,... = 0\}^\infty e^\{- \beta \sum_\{l=1\}^\infty s_l\epsilon_l\} = \prod_\{s=1\}^\infty \frac\{1\}\{1-e^\{-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta\}\}$$

Similarly to our previous treatment for phonons, we express the average
energy of the system per unit of volume $\langle E\rangle/V$ considering
a continuum distribution of energies: $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Energy_Density\}
\frac\{\langle E \rangle\}\{V\} = -\frac\{1\}\{V\}\frac\{\partial \log Q\}\{\partial \beta\} &= \frac\{1\}\{V\}\sum_\{l=1\}^\infty \frac\{\epsilon_le^\{-\beta\epsilon_l\}\}\{1 - e^\{-\beta\epsilon_l\}\} \notag\\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac\{1\}\{V\}g(\epsilon)  \frac\{\epsilon\}\{e^\{\beta\epsilon\}-1\} d\epsilon \notag\\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac\{1\}\{V\}\epsilon(\nu)g(\nu)\bar\{n\}(\nu) d\nu
\end\{aligned\}$$

where $\epsilon=h\nu$, according to the energy states defined by the
quantum theory of electromagnetic field;
$g(\nu)=\frac\{4\pi V\}\{c_0^3\}\nu^2$ is the density of states, and
$\bar\{n\}(\nu)$ is the Bose occupation given by:
$$\bar\{n\}(\nu) = \frac\{1\}\{\exp(\epsilon_\{s\}\beta)-1\} \notag$$

The integrand from
([\[Energy_Density\]](#Energy_Density)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Energy_Density"\}) can be expressed as: $$\label\{Planck\}
u(\nu) = \frac\{8\pi\}\{c^\{3\}\}\frac\{h\nu\}\{\exp(\beta h\nu)-1\}\nu^\{2\}$$

Which is Planck's Radiation Law.

We may also recover Wien and Rayleigh-Jeans laws as limits of Planck's
law,

1.  Long wavelength, $\frac\{hc\}\{kT\lambda\} < 1$. Here $$\label\{Eq29\}
    \bar\{\epsilon\}= \frac\{hc/\lambda\}\{\exp(hc/kT\lambda)-1\} \simeq kT$$

    And ([\[Eq29\]](#Eq29)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq29"\})
    becomes $$\label\{Eq30\}
    u(\lambda)= \frac\{1\}\{V\} \bar\{\epsilon\}(\lambda) g(\lambda) \simeq \frac\{8 \pi\}\{\lambda^\{4\}\} kT$$

    Which is Wien's law valid at long wavelengths.

2.  Short wavelength, $\frac\{hc\}\{kT\lambda\} >> 1$. Here $$\label\{Eq31\}
    \bar\{\epsilon\}= \frac\{hc\}\{\lambda\} \exp(-hc/kT\lambda)$$

    And ([\[Eq30\]](#Eq30)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq30"\})
    becomes $$\label\{Eq32\}
    u(\lambda)= \frac\{1\}\{V\} \bar\{\epsilon\}(\lambda) g(\lambda) \simeq \frac\{8 \pi hc\}\{\lambda^\{5\}\} \exp(-hc/kT\lambda)$$

    Which is the Wien's law valid at short wavelength.

Employing our statistical mechanics we readily obtained Planck's
radiation law.

We may also derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law for: $$\label\{Eq33\}
u = \int_0^\{\infty\} u(\nu) d\nu = \frac\{8\pi\}\{c^\{3\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} \frac\{h\nu\}\{\exp(\beta h\nu)-1\}\nu^\{2\}d\nu$$

Introducing $x=\beta h\nu$, this reduces to $$\label\{Eq34\}
u = \frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \int_0^\{\infty\} dx \frac\{x^\{3\}\}\{\exp(x)-1\} T^\{4\} = aT^\{4\}$$

Where $$\label\{Eq35\}
a = \frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \frac\{\pi^\{4\}\}\{15\}$$

In this way we obtain, using statistical mechanics, a law derived
previously using thermodynamics including all the numerical factors.
This gives Stefan's constant $\sigma$ in $$\label\{Eq36\}
E = \frac\{1\}\{4\} caT^\{4\} = \sigma T^\{4\}$$

As $$\label\{Eq37\}
\sigma =  \frac\{2\pi ck^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \frac\{\pi^\{4\}\}\{15\} = 5.67 \times 10^\{-5\} \frac\{erg\}\{cm^\{2\}-Sec-K^\{4\}\}$$

A measurement of $\sigma$ could then be used, for example, to determine
Planck's constant. Planck, in fact, determined h as the constant needed
in his radiation law to fit the observed spectral distribution law. This
gave him the value h = 6.55 $\times$ 10$^\{-27\}$ erg.sec which compares
with the present value of h = 6.625 $\times$ 10$^\{-27\}$ erg.sec

## Thermodynamic Properties of Photons

We may calculate all the thermodynamic properties of black body
radiation using statistical mechanics through the partition function
$Q$, where $$\label\{Eq38\}
F =  -kT\log(Q)$$

And $Q$ was derived as shown in
([\[Part_photon\]](#Part_photon)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Part_photon"\}). This is the basic method of statistical
thermodynamics. The aim is to reproduce all the thermodynamic properties
with all factors and constants evaluated. This gives $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq39\}
F &=  -kT\log\left(\prod_\{s=1\}^\{r\} (1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\}\right) \notag \\
F &=  -kT\sum_\{s=1\}^\{r\} \log(1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\} \notag \\
F &= -2kT  \int \frac\{d\Gamma\}\{h^\{3\}\} \log (1-\exp(-\epsilon_\{s\}\beta))^\{-1\} 
\end\{aligned\}$$

Where the $\epsilon_\{s\}$ are the single photon states and the factor of
2 arises from the two polarizations available to each photon. This can
be integrated in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most direct is to
integrate over phase space $(d\Gamma=dV\,\,4\pi p^\{2\}\,\,dp)$ and write
$\epsilon=pc$. Introducing the dimensionless variable
$x = \beta \epsilon = \beta pc$, the Helmholtz free energy is:
$$\label\{Eq40\}
F = -\frac\{1\}\{3\} \left\lbrace -\frac\{8\pi k^\{4\}\}\{(hc)^\{3\}\} \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} d(x)^\{3\} \,\, \log(1-\exp(-x)) \right\rbrace \,\, VT^\{4\}$$

The dimensionless integral here can be transformed into that appearing
in the constant of $a$ of ([\[Eq35\]](#Eq35)\{reference-type="ref"
reference="Eq35"\}), by an integration by parts, i.e., $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq41\}
I &= -  \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} d(x)^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) \notag \\
&= - (x^\{3\}) \log(1-\exp(-x))\bigg|_\{0\}^\{\infty\} + \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} x^\{3\} d[\log(1-\exp(-x))]
\end\{aligned\}$$

The first term vanishes because:

\(a\)
$\lim_\{x \to \infty\} x^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) \simeq \lim_\{x \to \infty\} x^\{3\} \exp(-x) = 0$

\(b\)
$\lim_\{x \to 0\} x^\{3\} \log(1-\exp(-x)) \simeq \lim_\{x \to 0\} x^\{3\} \log(x) = 0$

And $$\begin\{aligned\}
\label\{Eq42\}
I &= \int_\{0\}^\{\infty\} dx \frac\{x^\{3\}\}\{\exp(x)-1\} = \frac\{\pi\}\{15\}
\end\{aligned\}$$

Comparing ([\[Eq40\]](#Eq40)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq40"\}) and
([\[Eq35\]](#Eq35)\{reference-type="ref" reference="Eq35"\}), we get:
$$\label\{Eq43\}
F = -\frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\}$$

From F we may determine all other thermodynamic properties by
differentiation. For example, the entropy is $$\label\{Eq44\}
S = -\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial T\}\right) \bigg|_\{V\} = \frac\{4\}\{3\} aVT^\{3\}$$

The internal energy is: $$\label\{Eq45\}
U = F +TS = avT^\{4\}$$

The pressure is: $$\label\{Eq46\}
p = -\left(\frac\{\partial F\}\{\partial V\}\right) \bigg|_\{T\}  = \frac\{1\}\{3\} aT^\{4\}$$

Finally, the Gibbs free energy is: s $$\label\{Eq47\}
G = F + pV =  - \frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\} + \frac\{1\}\{3\} aVT^\{4\} = 0$$

This is zero as required $G=\mu N$ and the chemical potential $\mu=0$.
We may use these expressions to further verify thermodynamic
consistency, for example that
$C_\{V\} = T\frac\{\partial S\}\{\partial T\}\bigg|_\{V\}= \frac\{\partial U\}\{\partial T\}\bigg|_\{V\}$.

In summary, we have obtained the spectral distribution from the Bose
occupation in much the same way as we obtained the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution for a classical gas. The only other required ingredient was
the density of states. We have also obtained all the thermodynamic
properties using the partition function $Q$.
